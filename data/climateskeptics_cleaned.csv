Climate Alarm Hypocrisy,"I've been watching the climate change and environment subs, amazed at the ongoing garment-tearing and wailing about eliminating fossil fuels. (And eliminating capitalism too, generally.) ""Climate justice"" is a quintessential luxury obsession.

Are we not far better off today than we were without fossil fuel in the 1820s or so?

My dad was born in 1933 and they didn't even have electricity on their midwestern US farm until he was 10. They had no refrigerator. Grandma washed their clothes in a copper kettle on the kitchen stove.  And that was not even close to fossil-fuel-free either. The farm machinery was made in urban factories.  Watching people complain from their positions of historically unprecedented urban comfort seems like the height of hypocrisy.  

If I look around me everything I see was made possible by fossil fuel.

Everyone complaining about emissions should first walk their talk and do without burning anything. This includes no vegan foods farmed with petro.  Then they can call on others to follow their example.",climateskeptics

Sceptical of climate models,"After having read some Ipcc reports, if seems that much of the ""proof"" for the postulated high climate sensitivity to co2 hinges on parameter studies of climate models to temperature data going back only to the start of satellite records around 1978.

Having worked with fitting simulators to online data professionally, the climate model approach irks me on many levels. 

1. there is no clear separation between tuninig and validation datasets. 

2. gisp2 data going back 10000 years indicate that the dominant natural climate cycle having a 1000 year period, fitting of models should ideally be to at least one full period, so 1000 years, not 50 years of data.

3. if the recent 50 years have been part of a natural warming cycle, models which do not describe the 1000 year cycle in its structure will when tuned to data of recent warming inadvertently have parameters that are ""colored"" to favor warming.

4. models seem too complex when the aim is to study the relation between gmt and co2, when there is essentially one model output and a handful of significant inputs, a 3D model whose code fills 18000 pages likely is overparametrized, which may give poorer prediction capabilities than a model with fewer parameters in general.

5. Climate models are surprisingly not automatically tuned (probably because they are too complex) This is a big red flag if true. 

6. Researchers know that models have structural errors, i. e. important observed phenomena are not described correctly, such as cloud formation, yet the model is still used as basis for policy.

7. Backtesting of data is often neglected, or the implication of poor backtest performance is not appreciated
8. A general disinterest in paleoclimate because models are too complex to backtest against sparse proxy data (then maybe your model is too complex?) 


Personally I would very much like to see much simpler lumped (1D) models attempt to describe co2 and temperature proxy data for the last 10000 years, and see what co2 sensitivity such models find,I would actually trust the predictions of such a model far more than the pseudoscience of current climate models. Anyone aware of any such studies? 

I would trust more a 3D-climate model that were able to describe natural variability in paleoclimate temperature proxies. Anyone aware of any such studies? 

Ideally I would appreciate an open discussion with someone knowledgeable in the field, but I fear that practicioners are too invested in their method to be able to review it critically, and that anyone not working in the field will be subject to gatekeeping.

about a couple of entries in Judith Curry's blog week-in-review list (millennium of Arctic sea ice; a sunspot model),"I mention two [of many](https://judithcurry.com/2019/06/29/week-in-review-science-edition-104/). 

- listed first is [a study](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2018PA003508) about attempts to model the (North) North Atlantic over the last 2000 years.  Recently there have been a series of papers about proxies there, included off of Greenland. I looked at one (Kolling et al, 2017), about sea ice, which banded in their graphs the 'Roman Warm Period, Dark Ages Cold Period, Medieval Climate Anomaly [yup!] and Little Ice Age'. Which they had to do because those were obviously in the sediment. ie in the proxies.  Not to mention a clear 74 year cycle. Remember, Arctic sea ice is one of their babies and they pretend 1979-2012 has nothing to do with the AMO etc. ... So anyway, the abstract of this modeling summary paper has ""*with a specific focus on the dynamical changes that are not well inferred from the proxy records*"".. does 'not well inferred' mean 'not in the proxy records'? Count me skeptical 

- another link is to AGU [coverage](https://eos.org/articles/planetary-low-tide-may-force-regular-sunspot-sync-ups) of the planetary/sunspot model!  Notice the headline has to beg ""no, it's not pseudoscience'. As I have  posted before the mainstream has resisted this since the 1950s.

The British perspective.,"How the BBC exaggerate man-made global warming in the David Attenborough propaganda program!!

Even the IPCC admits that man-made warming in the last 70 years is only 0.3° C !!!!



Last year, the BBC issued guidelines instructing editors that inviting comment from ‘climate change deniers’ was ‘false balance’. In practice, this has meant that those who accept climate change is real, but less threatening than some such as Attenborough claim, have effectively been banished from the airwaves.
Now the Corporation has given acres of airtime to protesters demanding the overthrow of democratic governments and an almost immediate end to fossil fuel-derived power, heating and transport – in other words, the abrupt termination of civilisation as we know it.
Thunberg has become a global media darling, her pronouncements cherished as if they were holy writ. 
‘I want you all to panic,’ she told the Davos economic forum in January: and Attenborough’s film may well have persuaded viewers to do just that – and, perhaps, to join the Extinction Rebellion barricades. 

Watching it did fill me with horror, but not at the threat from global warming. It was at the way Sir David and the BBC presented a picture of the near future which was so much more frightening than is justified.
Climate science remains a field riven by deep uncertainties. The film largely glossed over these – and where faced with alternatives, it plumped unerringly for the most pessimistic version of the ‘truth’.
Let me be clear: I am not a ‘denier’. Global warming and climate change are real, in large measure caused by humans. According to the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), our emissions were responsible for more than half the 0.6C – 0.7C global average temperature rise recorded between 1951 and 2010.
But I am also convinced that the ‘panic’ Thunberg desires and Attenborough’s film will encourage is not helpful when it comes to making policy designed to tackle it. Moreover, it is a grotesque travesty of the truth to claim that ‘nothing’ has been done: for example, since 1990, UK emissions have fallen by 43 per cent, according to the Government’s Committee on Climate Change. Not only that, Government statistics say 56 per cent of our electricity came from low carbon sources in 2018, our last coal-fired power station will close in six years and the Government has pledged to ‘decarbonise’ electricity by 2030.
Above all, the Climate Change Act requires Britain to reduce its 1990 carbon emissions by no less than 80 per cent by the year 2050, making us the first major economy to make such a dramatic commitment. To say that ‘nothing’ has been done is as risible as it is dishonest.

The IPCC, regarded by mainstream scientists as the world’s most authoritative source, says there have been some changes, such as higher rainfall. But its Fifth Assessment Report, published in 2013, stated there are ‘no significant observed trends in global tropical cyclone frequency over the past century’. It added: ‘No robust trends in annual numbers of tropical storms, hurricanes and major hurricane counts have been identified over the past 100 years in the North Atlantic basin.’
A separate IPCC report last year said that cyclones in the tropics would in future be less numerous, although some would be stronger.
In 2014, a group of IPCC experts published a paper about flooding. So far, they said, ‘no gauge-based evidence has been found for a climate-driven, globally widespread change in the magnitude/frequency of floods.’
Another memorable segment of the film showed a father and son narrowly escaping from one of several devastating fires last year in California. These, too, were ascribed to global warming. Surprisingly, several recent scientific papers suggest that wildfires have been declining in recent years – even in California, where statistics gathered by the local agency, Calfires, says the number across the state has roughly halved since 1987, following a peak in the 1970s.
According to a study published by the Royal Society in 2016, ‘many consider wildfire as an accelerating problem’. In reality, however, says the study: ‘global area burned appears to have declined in past decades, and there is increasing evidence that there is less fire in the global landscape than centuries ago.’",climateskeptics

Long ago, but not far away...  
Thousands of millennia in the past, the air had plenty of CO2, and plants flourished. Many of them fell down and became coal. Other things happened, and carbon became rocks (especially chalk and limestone, made of [Ca(CO3)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_carbonate)) Yet other things happened, and [carbon became petroleum](https://np.reddit.com/r/AlternativeHypothesis/comments/a8bndq/fossil_fuel_a_fact_mistake_conspiracy_theory_or/).

Enter Gaia, the Earth goddess, and something hypothetical happened, humans were spawned [from other creatures](http://www.macroevolution.net/human-origins.html), and humans were really destined for something special (muck yeah, and it ain't only plastic!).

&gt; No one disputes that human’s activities have helped to increase atmospheric CO2 concentration, and it should not be in dispute that plants and Gaia are 'thankful' that humans have done so. At 400 ppm, the planet is a safer place to be and will be even safer at 1000 ppm.

[CO2 Science Summary](http://www.co2science.org/subject/c/summaries/carbondioxide.php)  
&gt; There is little reason to believe that (air's CO2 concentration leading to catastrophic global warming) will ever occur... it is climate change that drives changes in the air's CO2 content and **not** *vice versa*; air temperature always rises first, followed by an increase in atmospheric CO2 some 400 to 1000 years later.

"""Climate Change"" is Bullshit. Human CO2 Emissions Have Little Effect on Atmospheric CO2"," 

The United Nations *Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change*   (IPCC) agrees human CO2 is only (approximately) 5 percent and natural  CO2 is 95 percent of the CO2 inflow into the atmosphere. The ratio of  human to natural CO2 in the atmosphere must equal the ratio of the  inflows. Yet IPCC claims human CO2 has caused all the rise in  atmospheric CO2 above 280 ppm, which is now 130 ppm or 32 percent of  today’s atmospheric CO2.

To cause the  human 5 percent to become 32 percent in the atmosphere,  the IPCC model  treats human and natural CO2 differently, which is impossible because  the molecules are identical. IPCC’s Bern model artificially traps human  CO2 in the atmosphere while it lets natural CO2 flow freely out of the  atmosphere.

By contrast, a simple  Physics Model treats all CO2 molecules the same, as it should, and shows  how CO2 flows through the atmosphere and produces a balance level where  outflow equals inflow. Thereafter, if inflow is constant, level remains  constant.

The Physics Model has only  one hypothesis, that outflow is proportional to level. The Physics Model  exactly replicates the 14C data from 1970 to 2014 with only two  physical parameters: balance level and e-time. The 14C data trace how  CO2 flows out of the atmosphere.

The  Physics Model shows the 14CO2 e-time is a constant 16.5 years. Other  data show e-time for 12CO2 is about 4 to 5 years. IPCC claims human CO2  reduces ocean buffer capacity. But that would increase e-time. The  constant e-time proves IPCC’s claim is false.

IPCC  argues that the human-caused reduction of 14C and 13C in the   atmosphere prove human CO2 causes all the increase in atmospheric CO2.   However, numbers show these isotope data support the Physics Model and   reject the IPCC model.

The Physics  Model shows how inflows of human and natural CO2 into the  atmosphere  set balance levels proportional to their inflows. Each balance level  remains constant if its inflow remains constant. Continued constant CO2  emissions do not add more CO2 to the atmosphere. No CO2 accumulates in  the atmosphere.

Present human CO2  inflow produces a balance level of about 18 ppm. Present natural CO2  inflow produces a balance level of about 392 ppm. Human CO2 is  insignificant to the increase of CO2 in the atmosphere.  Increased  natural CO2 inflow has increased the level of CO2 in the  atmosphere.

The Climate Change Agenda,"We all know that trying to connect anything to the Climate Change Agenda that has to do with power grabs or depopulation is just a wacky conspiracy theory, but hear me out and let's take a little walk on the wild side......

Every  day, in meetings at all levels of government, representatives of Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), planning groups, and federal agents surround elected representatives and insist that their policies have nothing to do with international agendas. They regularly publish reports and rail against anyone even mentioning the names Agenda 21 or the new Agenda 2030. “No, no, no,” they insist. “Those people are just  crazy conspiracy theorists. Ours is just a local plan for our community.”

Elected Representatives are often confused. Issues and policies suddenly appear in front of them with sample, ready-made  legislation. And then the unending pressure begins for them to pass it. There is confusion, uncertainty and there is the herd mentality to pass legislation. And it’s passed without knowledge of its origins, its  purpose, and especially a lack of understanding of its consequences.  

What most of these legislators fail to understand is the direct  relationship much of this legislation has with a much larger agenda.  Most legislation interconnects with other pieces and parts contained in other legislation. 

&amp;#x200B;

### I. Global Warming/Climate Change

It has been so discredited in the true scientific community that proponents have become almost hysterical in their continued attempts to enforce Climate Change policy. Most recently the Justice Department is considering legal action against “deniers.”  Why don’t they stop, even to question if their science is sound? They instead use great energy to attack any scientist who does dare ask questions or finds data contrary to the “official” line. Why is it so vitally important that they  continue to promote something that clearly is, to say the least, questionable?

It’s because all of Agenda 21 policy is built on the premise that man is  destroying the Earth. Climate Change is their “proof.” To eliminate that premise is to remove all credibility and purpose for their entire agenda. They are willing to go to any length, even lies, to keep the climate change foot on our throats.

On the local level this translates into planning policy that controls energy use and the efforts to cut down on the use of cars, enforcement of the building of  expensive light rail train systems and bike paths and installation of smart meters, etc.

But don’t take my word for it. I’ll let them speak for themselves:

**“No matter if the science of global warming is all phony…climate change  provides the greatest opportunity to bring about justice and equality in the world.”** ***Christine Stewart (Former Canadian Minister of the Environment)*** 

**“We’ve got to ride this global warming issue. Even if the theory of global  warming is wrong, we will be doing the right thing in terms of economic  and environmental policy.”** ***Timothy Wirth (President, UN Foundation)***

**“It doesn’t matter what is true. It only matters what people believe is true.”** ***Paul Watson (Co-Founder of Green Peace.)***

### II. Fear of over population

Fear is the central driving force behind nearly every Sustainable policy initiative. It’s the real force behind Stack and Pack Smart Growth cities.

The fact is, in developed nations populations are actually going down. The only real growth in the US population in recent years has been from immigration, legal or otherwise. Open border immigration policy is actually implementation of Agenda 21 as part of the drive to destroy national sovereignty and “nation states.”

Environmentalists insist that the borders must be open to allow as many to immigrate here as possible. They argue that the U.S. has a greater ability to control them and protect the environment than if we left them in third world  countries. That’s because the Greens already have a stranglehold over our nation’s industry through massive environmental regulations.

In the face of their fear of overpopulation, however, studies have shown that there is no world wide over population crisis. In fact one study insists that we could put the entire population of the world in an area the size of Texas with a population density of Paris, France. Over population, and its accompanying environmental degradation, is a problem primarily in countries where the poor are deprived by government to improve their conditions. Nations that refuse to legalize private property ownership for the masses, for example, are a primary reason for growing poverty.

Meanwhile, Sustainablists work to keep these nations from developing or increasing energy use, thereby keeping them poor. Green regulations stop the building of infrastructure. They panic at the idea of increased energy use in developing nations. Instead of  working to solve the real problems—the root of poverty- they exploit the excuse of over population and advocate enforcing polices to drastically reduce populations. China’s brutal one child policy of forced abortions and sterilization has become their model.

Do you think I’m joking? Then consider these quotes from the Sustainablists:

**“Childbearing should be a punishable crime against society, unless the parents hold a government license. All potential parents should be required to use contraceptive chemicals, the government issuing antidotes to citizens chosen for childbearing.”** ***David Brower (Sierra Club)***

**“A reasonable estimate for an industrialized world society at the present  North American material standard of living would be 1 billion. At a more  frugal European standard of living, 2 to 3 billion would be possible.”** ***United Nations Global Biodiversity Assessment.***

### III. The destruction of the free market system.

We have heard statement after statement from the UN; from members of  Congress; the news media; and from Hollywood, all deriding the free market system as evil, corrupt and a tool of the rich to hold down the poor. So now, after deciding that the poor are expendable for the sake of stopping overpopulation, suddenly the planners are worried about them—if it leads to their ability to raid our bank accounts. So are they  really worried about protecting the environment—or are they actually honoring the tactics of Jesse James?

Redistribution of wealth is  behind every policy that comes out of the UN, and looking back at the Obama Administration as well. The EPA is the attack dog to shut down entire industries like coal. It has become very difficult to operate a  manufacturing business in the US, and nearly impossible to start a new one. Environmental protection is always the excuse. 

At the UN’s Rio + 20 Summit held in 2012, **the idea of “Zero Economic Growth” was  advocated** \- just to keep things fair. It was stated that even the  building of new roads upsets the status quo and disrupts a well ordered society. Such idiotic ideas are the driving force behind Sustainable Development. Again, images of the Dark Ages come to mind.

Yet,  consider “local” planning programs that cut off access roads, and again,  discourage cars. What about the EPA’s war on industry. Pretty hard to have economic growth without industry. The timber industry is killed and  communities die. Dams are torn down and farmers disappear. Zero Economic Growth in the making. Just local?

Again, not my words, let them tell you themselves:

**“We must make this an insecure and inhospitable place for capitalists and  their projects. We must reclaim the roads and plowed lands, halt dam  construction, tear down existing dams, free shackled rivers and return to wilderness millions of acres of presently settled land.”** ***Dave Foreman, (Earth First).***

**“Global sustainability requires the deliberate quest of poverty, reduced  resource consumption and set levels of mortality control”** ***Professor Maurice King (Population Control Advocate)***

**“We believe planning should be a tool for allocating resources…and  eliminating the great inequalities of wealth and power in our society…  because the free market has proven itself incapable of doing this.”** [*Plannersnetwork.org*](http://plannersnetwork.org/) ***Statement of Principles. the American Planning Association is a member and supporter of these principles.***  

### IV. Cheap Energy is the enemy of the Earth.

To the average person the drive to stop any ability to obtain cheap energy  makes no sense. People are hurting economically. Jobs are lost. Energy costs are skyrocketing. Any attempt to drill oil, fracking of shale gas, and mining coal are all vigorously blocked by government and green policy. Yet the government spends billions of dollars on “alternative  energy” such as wind and solar, which provides less than 3% of our energy needs. Why? What is the motivation to put such shackles on the US economic engine? The excuse is that energy use drives up CO2 emissions and accelerates global warming - the excuse necessary to “harmonize” the  US into the socialist, Sustainable global noose.

Many current state and local policies now are moving to increase taxes at the gas  pump to keep energy costs high. As the prices rise the “planners”  will insist that the only solution is to enforce the building of expensive public transportation.

But, according to some anti-energy advocates, the fear of cheap energy goes beyond environmental protection - energy availability helps build wealth for  individuals and removes them from the rolls of the dependent—the  opposite goal of sustainable policy.

**“Giving society cheap, abundant energy is the worst thing that could ever happen to the planet.”** ***Prof. Paul Ehrlich (Professor of Population Studies, Stanford University).***

**“Complex technology of any sort is an assault on human dignity. It would be  little short of disastrous for us to discover a source of clean, cheap,  abundant energy, because of what we might do with it.”** ***Amory Lovins (Rocky Mountain Institute).***  

**“The prospect of cheap fusion energy is the worst thing that could happen to the planet.”** ***Jeremy Rifkin (Greenhouse Crisis Foundation).***

In it, he links to this: https://envisionation.co.uk/index.php/nick-breeze/203-subsea-permafrost-on-east-siberian-arctic-shelf-now-in-accelerated-decline

where these scientists, Shakhova and Semiletov, talk about methane hotspots in the ESAS and how dangerous it could be yada yada yada. Is that different than hydrates/cathrates? I know the methane bomb is a myth, but I'm not sure if what this reddit poster is talking about and these scientists are talking about are different than that?

Alternative theory to explain global warming. No debunk so far,"Humans consume 10 million gigatons of water each year. 70% of that is used to water  plants in agriculture (1). The water on the fields has 3 ways to go:
 - sinking deep into lower levels of the soil 
 - evaporate 
 - being absorbed by the plants (what also eventually leads to evaporation, because plants evaporate water over the leaves)

Actually farmers try to increase field water efficiency (fraction of water used by plants to total water used) but let’s say only 10% evaporate. That means 700 000 gigatons of water evaporate each year. Most of it by Irrigation. Rivers are redirected and spread over huge agricultural areas. On that area the sun developes enough energy to evaporate the water while it would just run into  the ocean without human influence. So we are basically evaporating rivers all over the world. And that is much more efficient than digging for coal and burn it.

But what about rain? Water doesn’t stay in the atmosphere!

Yes, and that’s why many reliable sources claim human couldn’t influence water content in the atmosphere. Because it comes down again, it can’t increase, can it? Yes of course it can. The numbers of airplanes in the air is increasing even though they don’t stuck in the air. Around 16000 planes are in the air right now (2019) and this number is going to increase. Around 200000 takeoffs  every day, which means around 8000 take offs per hour. An average flight duration of 2 hours means, that when you take off, 16 000 other planes take off before you land. And if you increase the take offs per hour you will have more planes in the air, even if the average duration remains at 2 hours.
So the same thing with water. Water remains about 10 days in the atmosphere (2). As mentioned earlier, 700 000 gigatons are evaporated each year. That means 2000 gigatons per day. So within the 10 day lifetime of water 20 000 gigatons are  evaporated due to human influences. Compared to CO2 we emit 30 gigatons each year. according to the simple calculation above we increased the water content much more than we increased CO2. And that while H2O is a much more potent greenhouse gas than CO2. That would mean water vapor is the main cause of global warming!

Why can’t we measure the increase of water?

A gas needs around 1 year to reach each part of the atmosphere and even longer to be homogeneously mixed in the atmosphere. Since the lifetime of CO2 is so large, it actually is almost homogeneously mixed in the atmosphere. That means if you measure CO2 in only one spot, you know the content on alle other spots, because it’s the same.
H20 however has a short life time. The water content varies extremely in different location. When you see clouds, the water content is higher in the cloud than right next to it. You would need an infinite amount of measure spots to estimate the global water content in the atmosphere. Secondly the water content is around 2%. 2.43% or 2.44% is an increase by less than 1%. But for CO2 a difference between 0,03 and 0,04 is significant enough to be measured.

But we can’t add water to the atmosphere!

I never understood this argument. Ever hang out wet laundry? It dries in the sun. The water doesn’t disappear, it evaporates and is in the atmosphere. If the relative humidity (RH) was 100% the clothes wouldn’t dry. Sweating would be inefficient and you would have fog. At 100% RH you need to heat the air in order to take up more water. However when RH is below 100% it can take up more water. That’s the definition of RH. And as we observe in daily life, 100% RH is not common on surface altitude. That’s how sweating works, water is evaporating from the skin to cool the skin. And that’s possible without heating up the air, otherwise evolution wouldn’t have given us the ability to sweat.

Possible mistakes/errors

* most trivial would be a failed conversion between gigatons, cubic meter, kg etc.. because we are talking about millions of gigatons it’s possible. I think I did it right but maybe double check.
* error in the basic concept: maybe I overlooked something. Most likely the point why humans can’t add water to atmosphere. Many sources claim we have to heat up the air to increase water content. But I don’t understand why. I think it would be true at 100%RH but below we can ofcourse evaporate water as we observe in daily life. In Chile millions of liter of water are pumped to the surface and evaporated by the sun because in the remaining salt Lithium can be found. I think I gave enough example why I think we actually can evaporate water. The claim we can’t sounds so stupid to me, I don’t know why everyone says that.
* some more complex phenomenon is involved. Maybe water evaporated from agriculture has a different life time. A few hours would be enough though. The amount of water evaporation is so much higher than the CO2... Also i don’t see why water vapor from humans would behave different than natural vapor. We are basically just wetting the earths surface. Then the sun does the rest in natural processes.

"""Climate Change"" is Bullshit. Why Politicized Science is Dangerous","# ""Those who can make you believe absurdities can make you commit atrocities""

# ---Voltaire

&amp;#x200B;

**Imagine that there is a new scientific theory that warns of an impending crisis, and points to a way out.**

This theory quickly draws support from leading scientists, politicians and celebrities around the world. Research is funded by distinguished philanthropies, and carried out at prestigious universities. The crisis is reported frequently in the media. The science is taught in college and high school classrooms.

I don’t mean global warming. I’m talking about another theory, which rose to prominence a century ago.

Its supporters included Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, and Winston Churchill. It was approved by Supreme Court justices Oliver Wendell Holmes and Louis Brandeis, who ruled in its favor. The famous names who supported it included Alexander Graham Bell, inventor of the telephone; activist Margaret Sanger; botanist Luther Burbank; Leland Stanford, founder of Stanford University; the novelist H. G. Wells; the playwright George Bernard Shaw; and hundreds of others. Nobel Prize winners gave support. Research was backed by the Carnegie and Rockefeller Foundations. The Cold Springs Harbor Institute was built to carry out this research, but important work was also done at Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Stanford and Johns Hopkins. Legislation to address the crisis was passed in states from New York to California.

These efforts had the support of the National Academy of Sciences, the American Medical Association, and the National Research Council. It was said that if Jesus were alive, he would have supported this effort.

All in all, the research, legislation and molding of public opinion surrounding the theory went on for almost half a century. Those who opposed the theory were shouted down and called reactionary, blind to reality, or just plain ignorant. But in hindsight, what is surprising is that so few people objected.

Today, we know that this famous theory that gained so much support was actually pseudoscience. The crisis it claimed was nonexistent. And the actions taken in the name of theory were morally and criminally wrong. Ultimately, they led to the deaths of millions of people.

**The theory was eugenics, and its history is so dreadful — and, to those who were caught up in it, so embarrassing — that it is now rarely discussed. But it is a story that should be well know to every citizen, so that its horrors are not repeated.**

The theory of eugenics postulated a crisis of the gene pool leading to the deterioration of the human race. The best human beings were not breeding as rapidly as the inferior ones — the foreigners, immigrants, Jews, degenerates, the unfit, and the “feeble minded.” Francis Galton, a respected British scientist, first speculated about this area, but his ideas were taken far beyond anything he intended. They were adopted by science-minded Americans, as well as those who had no interest in science but who were worried about the immigration of inferior races early in the twentieth century — “dangerous human pests” who represented “the rising tide of imbeciles” and who were polluting the best of the human race.

The eugenicists and the immigrationists joined forces to put a stop to this. The plan was to identify individuals who were feeble-minded — Jews were agreed to be largely feeble-minded, but so were many foreigners, as well as blacks — and stop them from breeding by isolation in institutions or by sterilization.

As Margaret Sanger said, “Fostering the good-for-nothing at the expense of the good is an extreme cruelty … there is not greater curse to posterity than that of bequeathing them an increasing population of imbeciles.” She spoke of the burden of caring for “this dead weight of human waste.”

Such views were widely shared. H.G. Wells spoke against “ill-trained swarms of inferior citizens.” Theodore Roosevelt said that “Society has no business to permit degenerates to reproduce their kind.” Luther Burbank” “Stop permitting criminals and weaklings to reproduce.” George Bernard Shaw said that only eugenics could save mankind.

There was overt racism in this movement, exemplified by texts such as “The Rising Tide of Color Against White World Supremacy” by American author Lothrop Stoddard. But, at the time, racism was considered an unremarkable aspect of the effort to attain a marvelous goal — the improvement of humankind in the future. It was this avant-garde notion that attracted the most liberal and progressive minds of a generation. California was one of twenty-nine American states to pass laws allowing sterilization, but it proved the most-forward-looking and enthusiastic — more sterilizations were carried out in California than anywhere else in America.

Eugenics research was funded by the Carnegie Foundation, and later by the Rockefeller Foundation. The latter was so enthusiastic that even after the center of the eugenics effort moved to Germany, and involved the gassing of individuals from mental institutions, the Rockefeller Foundation continued to finance German researchers at a very high level. (The foundation was quiet about it, but they were still funding research in 1939, only months before the onset of World War II.)

Since the 1920s, American eugenicists had been jealous because the Germans had taken leadership of the movement away from them. The Germans were admirably progressive. They set up ordinary-looking houses where “mental defectives” were brought and interviewed one at a time, before being led into a back room, which was, in fact, a gas chamber. There, they were gassed with carbon monoxide, and their bodies disposed of in a crematorium located on the property.

Eventually, this program was expanded into a vast network of concentration camps located near railroad lines, enabling the efficient transport and of killing of 'undesirables'.

After World War II, nobody was a eugenicist, and nobody had ever been a eugenicist. Biographers of the celebrated and the powerful did not dwell on the attractions of this philosophy to their subjects, and sometimes did not mention it at all. Eugenics ceased to be a subject for college classrooms, although some argue that its ideas continue to have currency in disguised form.

But in retrospect, three points stand out. First, despite the construction of Cold Springs Harbor Laboratory, despite the efforts of universities and the pleadings of lawyers, there was no scientific basis for eugenics. In fact, nobody at that time knew what a gene really was. The movement was able to proceed because it employed vague terms never rigorously defined. “Feeble-mindedness” could mean anything from poverty to illiteracy to epilepsy. Similarly, there was no clear definition of “degenerate” or “unfit.”

Second, the eugenics movement was really a social program masquerading as a scientific one. What drove it was concern about immigration and racism and undesirable people moving into one’s neighborhood or country. Once again, vague terminology helped conceal what was really going on.

Third, and most distressing, the scientific establishment in both the United States and Germany did not mount any sustained protest. Quite the contrary. In Germany scientists quickly fell into line with the program. Modern German researchers have gone back to review Nazi documents from the 1930s. They expected to find directives telling scientists what research should be done. But none were necessary. In the words of Ute Deichman, “Scientists, including those who were not members of the \[Nazi\] party, helped to get funding for their work through their modified behavior and direct cooperation with the state.” Deichman speaks of the “active role of scientists themselves in regard to Nazi race policy … where \[research\] was aimed at confirming the racial doctrine … no external pressure can be documented.” German scientists adjusted their research interests to the new policies. And those few who did not adjust disappeared.

A second example of politicized science is quite different in character, but it exemplifies the hazard of government ideology controlling the work of science, and of uncritical media promoting false concepts. Trofim Denisovich Lysenko was a self-promoting peasant who, it was said, “solved the problem of fertilizing the fields without fertilizers and minerals.” In 1928 he claimed to have invented a procedure called vernalization, by which seeds were moistened and chilled to enhance the later growth of crops.

Lysenko’s methods never faced a rigorous test, but his claim that his treated seeds passed on their characteristics to the next generation represented a revival of Lamarckian ideas at a time when the rest of the world was embracing Mendelian genetics. Josef Stalin was drawn to Lamarckian ideas, which implied a future unbounded by hereditary constraints; he also wanted improved agricultural production. Lysenko promised both, and became the darling of a Soviet media that was on the lookout for stories about clever peasants who had developed revolutionary procedures.

Lysenko was portrayed as a genius, and he milked his celebrity for all it was worth. He was especially skillful at denouncing this opponents. He used questionnaires from farmers to prove that vernalization increased crop yields, and thus avoided any direct tests. Carried on a wave of state-sponsored enthusiasm, his rise was rapid. By 1937, he was a member of the Supreme Soviet.

By then, Lysenko and his theories dominated Russian biology. The result was famines that killed millions, and purges that sent hundreds of dissenting Soviet scientists to the gulags or the firing squads. Lysenko was aggressive in attacking genetics, which was finally banned as “bourgeois pseudoscience” in 1948. There was never any basis for Lysenko’s ideas, yet he controlled Soviet research for thirty years. Lysenkoism ended in the 1960s, but Russian biology still has not entirely recovered from that era.

Now we are engaged in a great new theory that once again has drawn the support of politicians, scientists, and celebrities around the world.

* Once again, the theory is promoted by major foundations.
* Once again, the research is carried out at prestigious universities.
* Once again, legislation is passed and social programs are urged in its name.
* Once again, critics are few and harshly dealt with.
* Once again, the measures being urged have little basis in fact or science.
* Once again, groups with other agendas are hiding behind a movement that appears high-minded.
* Once again, claims of moral superiority are used to justify extreme actions.
* Once again, the fact that some people are hurt is shrugged off because an abstract cause is said to be greater than any human consequences.
* Once again, vague terms like sustainability and generational justice — terms that have no agreed definition — are employed in the service of a new crisis.

I am not arguing that global warming is the same as eugenics. But the similarities are not superficial. And I do claim that open and frank discussion of the data, and of the issues, is being suppressed. Leading scientific journals have taken strong editorial positions of the side of global warming, which, I argue, they have no business doing. Under the circumstances, any scientist who has doubts understands clearly that they will be wise to mute their expression.

One proof of this suppression is the fact that so many of the outspoken critics of global warming are retired professors. These individuals are not longer seeking grants, and no longer have to face colleagues whose grant applications and career advancement may be jeopardized by their criticisms.

In science, the old men are usually wrong. But in politics, the old men are wise, counsel caution, and in the end are often right.

The past history of human belief is a cautionary tale. We have killed thousands of our fellow human beings because we believed they had signed a contract with the devil, and had become witches. We still kill more than a thousand people each year for witchcraft. In my view, there is only one hope for humankind to emerge from what Carl Sagan called “the demon-haunted world” of our past. That hope is science.

But as Alston Chase put it, “when the search for truth is confused with political advocacy, the pursuit of knowledge is reduced to the quest for power.”

That is the danger we now face. And this is why the intermixing of science and politics is a bad combination, with a bad history. We must remember the history, and be certain that what we present to the world as knowledge is disinterested and honest.

I've been doing activism lately, among other things against climate change. It has occurred to me that while I am somewhat familiar with the arguments, studies and data that suggest human made climate change is real, I do not know much about arguments and data that suggest the opposite.

I want to see both sides here so I can draw my own conclusions having seen all the arguments, I don't want to form my opinion on the topic with only information from my echo chamber. Please send me arguments against climate change, as well as scientific studies. I have lots of free time in the next 24 hours, so I can hopefully read through several studies.

Here's my current opinion on the topic so we'll have a starting point for the debate:

""Greenhouse gases like CO2, methane and others are causing the greenhouse gas effect which increases the average temperature on Earth's surface. This has allowed life on Earth to develop in the first place. Due to heavy use of fossil fuels, animal agriculture and others, humanity is rapidly increasing the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, pushing the warming effect beyond the natural balance. This is, and will be causing, according to scientific predictions, biodiversity loss, an increase of global mean temperature, an increase of extreme weather events, loss of arable land to desertification loss of living space due to flooding, and several hundreds of millions of refugees.""

I look forward to an enlightening conversation and to reading some studies. Thanks in advance for sending me arguments and sources.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit 1: Thanks a lot for all the sources and articles sent already, it will take me some time to read through them, I might not be able to respond to each of you personally, especially if the rate of informative answers with sources continues at this rate.

I am from r/collapse. It is rank with confirmation bias. I came here for some good counter arguments and hopefully good news.,"I am from r/collapse. I joined some 2 months back when i found it while browsing some other news article regarding doomsday.

We have absolutely no hopeful news there at all. This can't be. There are people doing a lot of stuff and there has to be some good news. This smelled like confirmation bias. So I came here looking for counter arguments.

Here is what i know:

1. Permafrost has a lot of methane frozen away. (Is this true? How did it get frozen there in the first place?)

2. Methane is a very potent green house gas. Depending upon how you count it is 70-83 times more potent than CO2.

3. We have taken carbon out of the ground and released it into the atmosphere in last 150 years. We increased the co2 levels to 412ppm from~250ppm. This has already increased the average temp by 0.8C from pre industrial levels.


4. Increasing temperature melts white ice that reflects suns light. This creating a feedback loop that further increases the temp.

5. One day we will melt permafrost and release methane. This will dramatically increase temperature. This will melt more permafrost and release more methane and thus create another feedback loop.

6. All this temp increase will be as bad as permian extinction when some volcano caused this permafrost (or was it clathrate) to release methane and kill 90% of all life. This is extremely bad scenario when permafrost releases 5% of its methane in to the air when one fine day melting sets off one of the clathrate guns.

Meanwhile increasing temps would cause extreme weathers, disrupt food security, increase spread of diseases which were checked by cool climate etc. etc. humans are bad neighbors under stressful conditions and we have a collapse.",climateskeptics

The ice caps melting at an alarming rate each year, negatively affecting thousands of animals.

Ticks will migrate into and infest areas where you used to enjoy hiking, due to them coming out earlier each year.

Trees killed in an unprecedented flood in Italy. Mass cattle die-off in Australia's post-drought floods.

Look up the ski resort in Chacaltaya, Bolivia and see how it's doing.

Each year, human beings release an increasing amount of carbon dioxide (C02) into the atmosphere; at present, around 40 billion tons per annum.

In 2018, there were 14 weather and climate disaster events with losses exceeding $1 billion each across the United States.

A small rodent named  the Bramble Cay melomys that lived only on a single island off Australia is likely the world's first mammal to become a casualty of climate change. Since 1998, the part of the island that sits above high tide has shrunk from 9.8 acres to 6.2 acres. That means the island's vegetation has been shrinking, and the rodents have lost about 97 percent of their habitat.

Or how about all of these actual facts presented here:  [https://www.un.org/en/sections/issues-depth/climate-change/](https://www.un.org/en/sections/issues-depth/climate-change/)

Have to subtract about 10-30 SN's to get the actual, historically comparative data.

"from 2018, remember the ocean floor methane hydrate hype?","The money quote for this forum from [a 2018 study](https://phys.org/news/2018-01-ocean-ancient-methane.html) is

&gt;Our data suggest that even if increasing amounts of methane are released from degrading hydrates as climate change proceeds, catastrophic emission to the atmosphere is not an inherent outcome""


background: 10-5 years ago alarmists used to go on and on about accelerations involving methane release. *Warming will cause even more warming!*  was screamed to the tune of 'we are all going to die!' by the climate industrial complex barbershop quartet. An RCP on steroids.

Not only did this hypothesis take a hit when (after around 2010) atmospheric methane levels stopped following  emissions but, more fundamentally, about bacteria which eats the gas. 

The methane came from two places, in theory: melting taiga and ocean bottom clathrates (aka hydrates)

- taiga: a few years ago, it was measured there is less  CH4 over when it melts than there is when it is  frozen (because the bacteria comes to life). Less, not more.

- ocean floor, last year, the OP link: using D/H ratio, methane released from ocean floors does not make it to the surface

So much for that acceleration, super-quickly forgotten by the climate hamsters.

The First Global Revolution (1991),"My cause for skepticism lies in the motives of those who refer to climate change to demand more power and money from the people. If you trace back the history of UN groups and activities on climate change, you'll quickly arrive at the think tank ""Club of Rome"" which was founded among others by David Rockefeller (oil and banking billionaire).

This think tank published an initial critique on economic growth (""The Limits to Growth"") in 1972, followed by - more interestingly - a blueprint to how the world should be run in the 21st century: ""The First Global Revolution"". This latter book was published in 1991, closely preceding the UN conference in Rio in 1992 that kicked off environmental efforts (from the UN perspective that's Agenda 21 followed by Agenda 2030).

They literally said in the book, and this does appear to be a legitimate quote:

&gt;Because of the sudden absence of traditional enemies, ""new enemies must be identified.""[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_First_Global_Revolution#cite_note-King70-2)  ""**In searching for a new enemy to unite us, we came up with the idea  that pollution, the threat of global warming, water shortages, famine  and the like would fit the bill**....All these dangers are caused by human  intervention, and it is only through changed attitudes and behavior  that they can be overcome. The real enemy then, is humanity itself.""[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_First_Global_Revolution#cite_note-King115-3)

So this would be quite consistent with the idea that environmental problems are being hijacked in an effort to gain power and money for unelected elites, in essence taking us back to NWO conspiracies. Looking into the background of many UN representatives, they are in many cases also from big oil and finance, and some have been involved in bad corruption scandals, so it's not an immediately credible claim to make that they are in it purely for the good of all mankind.

There's also this ongoing conflict between UN / Western goals of reducing CO2 emissions and supporting mass immigration and overpopulation, most of which typically trace back to rich and powerful supporters as well ( [http://www.centuryinitiative.ca/about/](http://www.centuryinitiative.ca/about/) , [https://www.weforum.org/reports/business-case-migration](https://www.weforum.org/reports/business-case-migration) , [https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-18519395](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-18519395) ).

There's the argument that nobody cares for the UN anyway and they have no say in anything, but Western governments and supranational organizations largely seem to agree immediately on most of these things. I'm not  sure how these dominant globalist organizations relate to socialist / green parties though.

Recommend regular reading of The Drudgereport, Breitbart, and The Watchers to keep apprized of some of the more interesting, useful and detailed news, which is unlikely to be seen on the ""Nightly Snoozes"".

For the more extreme afficianados, be careful with Infowars. It's loaded with a lot of anti-vaxxers and other info processing problems.

But recall, the greatest growth. new events occurring, does not any longer come from the standard news networks and what they report. Rather, given the massive decline of the sciences from junk science reports, which esp is damaging medical pharmacologies, just do a lot of careful checking to ascertain what's ""Likely"" going on.

As far as today's news in the Middle East and the climate of events there, Jpost.com of Jerusalem for weather and other such; and the very interesting Dailystar.com.lb from Beirut, which gives a more expansive and interesting viewpoint about Middle East events and climate events, as well.

Lots of times the Jpost and the Daily Star are the ONLY sources giving details about what's going on with the weather there, confirming the problems, as well. Such as the loss of about 50% of Iran's Agro land and spring plantings, which will have a devastatin effect upon their food production. Starvation widely is possible.

And 40% of bridges and transport infrastructure damaged by storms, well past easy repairs, within the last few weeks.

So read widely, and as a former older, yet highly experienced woman once told me so presciently &amp; wisely:

Read widely and compare, compare, compare to find out what's likely going on.

Better wisdom than that have yet to find regarding climate events and related weather news, outside of the Watchers.",climateskeptics

The skeptic position,"My sense is that most skeptics agree that the Earth has been warming since the 1800s. The questions are

- how much of that global warming is anthropogenic (this can diverge from the consensus that the majority is human caused)

- how much of the anthropogenic warming is related to co2 emissions (deforestation, albedo change, urban heat can have their own share)

- how much global temperature affects local climate and weather (we can potentially make all the changes to remove any human effect on global temperature, and still have huge changes in climate)

- what extent are the negative effects of local climate and weather changes (alarmism says we're all going to become climate refugees and then die. Maybe we just crank up the ac and grow coffee in Canada)

- what positive effects we might see (higher co2 could lead to food abundance)

- what the cost to transition to a zero carbon economy is (many act like this has no cost to quality of life, but indications are that limiting carbon economies would lead to suffering)

I'd even go further to say that to be a ""climate change denier"", one would need to deny that any changes in local climates are occurring over decades.

Won't it all solve itself in the long run of this planet?," 

So, I am going to purpose what I think is an unpopular idea and see how others feel. So, I agree that climate change is real and we're causing it. BUT, I argue that the climate we want to maintain is OUR climate.

The earth has seen many different climates and even land shapes in it's history. There are many factors both on this ball of rock and in the space we fly through that effect air temperature, rain volumes, hurricanes, etc etc everyday.

We're hoping to find a way to maintain the status quo of this epoch of the earth's history, which is dominated by large, warm blooded animals that have live births. We want to maintain it within these limits to ensure that our very special species can continue on growing and adapt till we even possibly reach the stars...

That's all great, but neither ""the earth"" nor life on it much care about that. I believe no matter how bad we screw it up even to the point of nuclear winter, the earth WILL recover and life WILL go on. I know that it could take 100s of millions of years to get back to the diversity we have today, but I honestly believe it WILL happen no mater what we do.

To that end, I am saying that even our most ardent environmentalists are trying to protect something that is inherently selfish, OUR world. There is NO way that we can predict that might come AFTER us would be better or worse. Yet, WHO are we to decide how and when it happens?",climateskeptics

Skepticism vs Denialism,"Seen far too many posts and comments on here that seem to confuse the two. 

If you’re skeptical, you don’t believe something but it’s still possible for you to believe it’s  true or exists.

I just got ghosted by a commenter here (you know who you are) who got frustrated and decided I was being unreasonable and wasn’t worth replying to. This was because I was skeptical of what he said, and I thoroughly supported my contention.  I see this a lot too, not just here. Commenters just seemingly ceasing to exist when another makes a good point they can’t disprove easily. 

I understand leaving a conversation if the other is being rude or is dense, but if you’d rather ditch a conversation that you can’t win instead of actually think about what the other is saying, then you’re not being very skeptical are ya?

You’re allowed to believe whatever you want, but if you’re not gonna bother actually being skeptical, you’re just a Denier.",climateskeptics

China and Climate Hysteria,"I asked a friend who lived in China for years whether there is media coverage there about global warming and urgent appeals to take action to stop it.  Here is what he said.
-------

In the pre-Xi days there were environmentalists that were calling out the situation in China.  However most of these coalesced around international NGOs.  When Xi came into power the govt clamped down on international NGOs and closed down online media that was not congruent with Chinese government policy.

At the same time the Chinese government know it has an environmental disaster on its hands and knows as part of its ability to maintain control of public sentiment it must address the environmental hazards that are apparent to all people.  

There is no independent media.  So any call on the government to ""take action to reduce emissions"" would have to come from the government itself, which controls the media.",climateskeptics

Record High Temperatures - Year of Record Disappearing?,"In today's National Post there is an article on climate change. Accompanying the article is a photo of a protestor at a rally last Saturday in India. Their sign says: ""It was 84 degrees near the Arctic Ocean this weekend as CO2 hit its highest level in human history.""

I thought, ""How unusual is that?"" and discovered, not very. For example, Tuktoyaktuk - July 2, 1998, 30.4°C (86.7°F). 

However, when I checked other locations around the Arctic Ocean the information became vague. For example, the weather base report for Murmansk states:

&gt;The highest recorded temperature in Murmansk is 91.2°F (32.9°C), which was recorded in July. 

https://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=31122&amp;cityname=Murmansk%2C+Murmansk%2C+Russia&amp;units=metric

Similarly, the Wikipedia page for Murmansk under climate, has the 32.9°C record tabulated for July without a year.

This suggests the record was set last July without actually saying so.

"""Climate Changed"" Nobel Conference - propaganda or science?","  

Happy Sunday! I’m incredibly impressed with the depth of knowledge on this thread. I’m sharing this for a 10k ft assessment and partially for the amusement factor.

My alma mater holds an annual Nobel Conference. I usually ignore most emails from them, but the topic of this year’s conference caught my eye. **“Climate Changed”**… past tense. I took a quick look at the agenda and politely asked which speaker represented the contrarian opinion (see response below). The response was that “no one will represent that view”, “the Nobel Conference cannot present a position with no support”, and that “the scientific consensus is clear and unassailable”. It’s pointless to engage in a lengthy debate, but I’m willing to make one more attempt to suggest that this conference is closer to propaganda-fest than scientific discussion.

Here are my questions for the group (looking for quick-twitch bullets). Where do these speakers rank on the zealot scale? How many contributors were in the group that received the climate change Nobel Prize? How politically compromised is the Nobel Foundation? Who are the leading academics in the ‘skeptic’ community?

However, the people concerned about climate on Reddit are unconcerned about China's rapidly increasing emissions.  Whenever anyone posts proof in various subs that the US is flat on emissions, downvotes ensue. There is intense focus on fixing blame on the U.S. no matter what positive facts are shared.

Having helped implement Chinese government PR campaigns they designed to influence their trade negotiations with President Bush, I've personally witnessed the Chinese being very strong with managing political issues. I've helped Chinese buyers orchestrate media coverage of multi-billion-dollar purchases of goods like heavy equipment and ag commodities for the sole purpose of influencing trade negotiations to their benefit.

I will start.

- Carbon dioxide enhances the greenhouse effect.

- Humans are approximately 50% for climate change.

- Extreme weather events are not on the uptrend. At least the deaths caused by them.

- Climate models should not be taken literally as they rarely include feedback loops and they smoothen out certain long-term trends.

- Our current understanding of the climate system is shaky.

Change The Name!,"If this sub changed its name to Climatefacts or ClimateHope or Climatesuccess it would serve at least three useful purposes:

1. It would engage and inform people who are afraid the world is ending because of US energy use. That balance and encouragement needs to happen.
2. It's less polarizing and less subject to easy ridicule. (Nobody with a brain is skeptical about ""climate."") 
3. Climate ""hope"" or ""success"" is language that drills right into the amagdalya, where climate alarm messages are especially adept at reaching. (Brain wiring almost certainly has something to do with climate hysteria.)

I'm guessing this will get a million downvotes but I don't give a shit.  Our food supply is at risk because of climate hysteria. I work on the front lines of climate alarm, trying to help farmers continue the delicate balance of feeding 7 billion people.  Activists who know nothing about farming are using climate doom to control farm decisions. The results could truly be very bad. Food security is not as secure as it would seem from inside a grocery store. 

It's time people who can actually make a difference by taking a stand for SEEKING the truth begin using information strategies that actually work. It's time for balance-based messages that work as well as the message strategies that scare people into believing the earth is doomed.

Earth is not doomed because of climate. Civilization is doomed because people don't know what the truth is at all any more, and it doesn't even matter. After all, if we can't even count genders how are we to make global decisions about even more complex issues?",climateskeptics

Bin Wars - a prelude to Carbon Wars,"The UK has had Bin Wars for a few years. Bin Wars have now arrived in Western Australia courtesy of the state government. The standard bin arrangement is a general waste bin and a recyclables bin. The definition of recyclables varies from country to country. Likewise the arrangements made. Often recyclables are, after collection, put through to general waste. The state government is now waging Bin Wars on the local populace via the local councils.

Bin Wars means extra bins with coloured lids are now being supplied by the local councils. Each bin has a sticker that authorises its use. These are for general waste and for various categories of recyclables. And a one size fits all approach is being made. eg. people often use kitchen waste for their gardens or they just bury it. However you will be given a kitchen waste bin in which you can accumulate over many months a stinking soggy mass of kitchen waste which will add to the pleasant and natural odeur of your surrounds and drive your visitors away.

Next the councils will chip the bins and examine the contents and they will send a break down of the contents to an app. on your smartphone. This is already operational in some places.

And if you think that this is a massive waste of money and resources and you point out to all the petroleum being used in the extra bins you are 100% right.

15 Reasons to be Skeptical of Human Caused Climate Change,"**1) CO2 has a trivial warming effect.** 

The  measured radiative forcing at the surface from CO2 from 2000-2010 was  0.2 W/m2 from the 22ppmv increase (Feldman et al 2012), which works out  at about 0.01 W/m2 per 1ppmv. However, because of the logarithmic nature  of CO2, regular 1ppmv increments of CO2 would produce ever-diminishing  increments of radiative forcing and so 0.01 W/m2 per 1ppmv would be a  generous linear relationship to use as of 2018. According to the [**Keeling Curve**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keeling_Curve),  CO2 is increasing at the rate of about 2.5 ppmv/year. Therefore, the  annual radiative forcing from CO2 would be about 0.025 W/m2, which would  be enough to raise the global temperature at the surface by about  0.0046°C under the S-B law\*1 (assuming none of it gets absorbed in the  evaporation of seawater). Far from being catastrophic, such a trivial  rate of warming would be lost in the inaccuracies of the measurements.

**2) The effects of CO2 are overwhelmed by water vapour.**

The  Earth’s mean surface temperature is currently about 15°C while its   blackbody temperature is -18°C and the temperature difference of   about 33°C represents a large amount of ‘radiative forcing’ by the   atmospheric greenhouse. In fact it amounts to [**about**](https://www.giss.nasa.gov/research/briefs/schmidt_05/) 153 W/m2. The concentration of water vapour in the atmosphere is on average 1% (Source: [**NASA Earth Fact Sheet**](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-VBj5y2ptTg0/W6RlfaUqyII/AAAAAAAAJdw/aHTI3fI1sTwuBJ40j-BkRP12N6FliObcACPcBGAYYCw/s1600/fffffffffffw.PNG))  while the concentration of CO2 is 0.04%. Hence water vapour is about 25  times more abundant than CO2 in the atmosphere and pound for pound it  also has a greater potency than CO2 as well because it absorbs energy  over a far wider frequency in the electromagnetic spectrum (See graph [**here**](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-xNGgmlI9ei8/W5uz3ogVBFI/AAAAAAAAJXE/xKJnvu1IFhoHPtsAY0BUdb0_d0sdfxWmgCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/uohfewiufhiuhuigfrhyg.gif)). CO2 comprises  approximately 4% of the total atmospheric greenhouse by volume and  since it is a weaker greenhouse gas than  water vapour it follows logically that it cannot be  contributing anymore than 6 W/m2 to the total greenhouse radiative  forcing of 153 W/m2 whereas water vapour should contribute upwards of  146 W/m2. 

**3) The 13C/12C  ratio confirms that CO2 has a small life-time and because of this short  life-time there is only a tiny percentage of human CO2 residing in the  atmosphere.** The short atmospheric life-time for CO2 has been  confirmed by the observations of the atmospheric 13C/12C ratio. Some 99%  of atmospheric CO2 consists of the 12C isotope with the remaining 1%  consisting of 13C. The 13C/12C ratio is commonly referred to as δ13C.  δ13C is the difference between the ratio of 13C/12C  in a substance  compared to the standard of Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite  (VPDB) minus one.  The number is multiplied by one-thousand and expressed  as “per mil”  (parts per thousand). Anthropogenic CO2 has an approximate δ13C of  about [**-29**](http://cdiac.ess-dive.lbl.gov/trends/emis_mon/emis_mon_co2) (with  values ranging from -20 to -44) and natural biogenic CO2 is similar  with a δ13C of -26. The natural atmospheric CO2 reservoir has a δ13C of  about -7 when in [**equilibrium**](http://www.co2web.info/ESEFVO1.pdf) with dissolved CO2 in the oceans. The CO2 in the atmosphere (as of 2015) has a δ13C of [**-8.3**](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Yr37ZhP6xIE/W46ueSK06hI/AAAAAAAAJTs/ckZHyVpSt_c0l3Qnj6iGvcKYuQkQYkQ_wCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/c13_mlo_spo.png). Thus, the amount of anthropogenic CO2 in   
the  atmosphere is around 6%\*2 (i.e. 6% of -29 and 94% of -7) with the rest  of CO2 in the atmosphere (i.e. 94%)  being isotopically-indistinguishable\*3 from natural sources.

**4)  The demonstrable impotence of atmospheric CO2 as a driver of global  warming is evidenced by the fact that from 1998-2012 the global surface  temperature increased at the risible rate of 0.05°C per decade** (Source: [**IPCC AR5**](https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/syr/SYR_AR5_FINAL_full.pdf)) despite the fact that humans emitted a total of 30% of our cumulative emissions since 1850 (See graph [**here**](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-MAl1ps75dhk/W6KDJnCSQeI/AAAAAAAAJdY/i5dPwPihldQD-Gcbl8Xlbmmaj26xovHAQCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/global-co2-human-emissions-250-years-30-50-85.gif)).

**5) The “97% consensus” figure that CAGW-advocates faithfully, unremittingly parrot is misleading.**

One of the most cited papers purporting to demonstrate a 97% consensus on AGW was [**John Cook 2013**](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/8/2/024024).   This paper referenced a total of 12,271 papers and these papers were   split up into 7 categories. Category 1 included only 65 papers that   claimed humans were the “primary cause” of global warming. Category 2  included 934 papers that acknowledged AGW was a “known fact”. Category 3  included 2,933 papers that acknowledged “greenhouse gases cause  warning”. Category 4 took “no position” and 5, 6, 7, either implicitly  or explicitly rejected AGW. The 97% consensus was arrived at by taking  the first 4 categories (which had around 12,000 papers) and counting  them as “for” AGW. However, most CAGW-skeptics would agree that AGW is  a “known fact” and that “greenhouse gases cause warning” and  therefore  skeptics could be included in the 97%. Category 1 was the  only one  which included papers that claimed that humans were the  “primary cause”  of global warming (i.e. over 50%) and that included only  65  papers. The 97% consensus that humans are the “primary cause” of global  warming is really a 0.5% consensus (i.e. 65 papers of 12,271) because  category 1 was the only category that explicitly endorsed the idea that  humans were the “primary cause” of global warming.

**6)  CO2 behaves somewhat logarithmically and the more of it there is in the atmosphere the less warming each molecule will have.**  The logarithmic effect of CO2 is  apparently due to the availability of  photons of the required frequency  that are absorbed. The vast majority  of the warming from CO2 comes from the first 20ppmv and after  that CO2 has essentially no effect (See graph [**here**](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-r7V5GVWdyGM/W6EZLvTg2wI/AAAAAAAAJYY/fd4rTV8Pn6cEVUAY-NqUr_kJI3urEhl8wCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/log-graph-lindzen-choi-webyyyyyy.gif)). The  insignificance of CO2 as  a climate driver is further corroborated by  the fact that Atmospheric  Emitted Radiance Interferometer measurements  have shown that the warming  from CO2 amounts to 0.01 W/m2 per 1ppmv  ([**Feldman et al 2012**](http://asl.umbc.edu/pub/chepplew/journals/nature14240_v519_Feldman_CO2.pdf)). That means every 1ppmv of CO2 that stays in the atmosphere has a warming effect at the surface of 0.0018°C.

**7) CO2  is  often claimed to be higher than it has been for about 650,000  thousand  years, thereby implying that the 40% increase in  atmospheric CO2 since 1850 must be human-induced.**

This  is based on ice-core data. However, ice-core is not a “closed-system”  and various fractionation processes such as gravitational compression  and the formation of clathrates can [**underestimate and contaminate**](http://21sci-tech.com/2006_articles/IceCoreSprg97.pdf) the original gas concentrations within the ice. Stomata data and direct chemical measurements ([**Georg Beck 2007**](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1260/095830507780682147)) show more variability with atmospheric CO2 as high as [**440ppmv**](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-eMhJrcf2W7s/W6dshBFvQII/AAAAAAAAJfg/frE0RtQC0N0wQsZUUkrAakJuoYblcASCQCKgBGAs/s1600/NY20081e.jpg). Furthermore,  different ice-core extraction methods can yield different results. The  long-term wet-extraction method shows CO2 as high as 900ppmv ([**Jaworowski et al 1992**](http://www.co2web.info/np-m-119.pdf)) whereas the short-term extraction method shows much lower concentrations. 

**8) The  rate of warming is not unusual. It’s  often suggested that the current  rate of warming is unprecedented, thereby implying that the current  warming must be caused by humans.**

But  the IPCC may want to explain why the global mean surface temperature   increased at virtually the same rate from 1860-1880, as it did between   1910-1940 and from 1975-1998 and 1975-2009 (See [**here**](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-jWcLoyM1uTE/Ww_HdRXxaKI/AAAAAAAAIzs/GBcuzYZXPfYqa2d32kQuEWI7e3RINdLzwCKgBGAs/s1600/Hadley-global-temps-1850-2010-web.gif)).  Human CO2-emissions  increased by almost 3,500% from 1860-1880 to  1975-1998 and yet the rate  of warming stayed essentially the same. The  warming between the years  1860-1880 must have been natural because the  IPCC’s own [**logarithmic equation**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiative_forcing) for  calculating radiative forcing (RF) increases from CO2 increases only  gives 0.028 W/m2 of RF (or a total temperature increase of about  0.02°C — with the hypothesized positive [**feedbacks included**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiative_forcing)). The data for anthropogenic CO2-emissions are from CDIAC and it can be seen [**here**](http://cdiac.ess-dive.lbl.gov/ftp/ndp030/global.1751_2011.ems) (note  that units are million metric tonnes; to convert to CO2 multiply by  3.67 and then to convert to gigatonnes divide by 1,000). The  time-periods and warming trends below are from the [**2010 BBC interview with climatologist Phil Jones**](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8511670.stm).

**9) Clouds could explain a portion of the assumed temperature  increase between 1971-2009.**  Clouds simultaneously cool and warm the  planet. They reflect incoming  solar radiation back out into space  contributing to the planet’s albedo  and they warm the planet by  re-emitting long-wave radiation back  towards the surface. Their overall  effect is to cool the planet to a  tune of [**20**](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ywxyJSBChUo/W54rkYaQ59I/AAAAAAAAJXs/ruCU3GM32XA3O_TuSczdEfD9-LHnD9TKwCPcBGAYYCw/s640/Captureygfyhfyhfhf.PNG) W/m2. Therefore, a general decrease in cloud-cover will lead to warming. [**Warren et al 2012**](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RaI3Zb-vWk0/W5ZpKlUOc1I/AAAAAAAAJVo/KYLKg_GF2Z8S733K1Oo0vSgrLPnfsEQoQCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/global_cloudiness%2B%25281%2529iiii.png)  estimates a reduction in global cloudiness of 1.56% between  1971-2009. Assuming a reduction in general global cloudiness of 1.56%  that equates to 3 W/m2 of increased shortwave radiation according to  Reed’s (1977) Flux [**Formula**](https://www.pmel.noaa.gov/pubs/outstand/mcph1166/mcph1166.shtml).  However, for every 3 W/m2 of radiation that clouds warm the planet by  due to re-emitting long-wave radiation they have a cooling effect of  5 W/m2 due to reflecting incoming shortwave radiation ([**IPCC AR5**](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ywxyJSBChUo/W54rkYaQ59I/AAAAAAAAJXs/ruCU3GM32XA3O_TuSczdEfD9-LHnD9TKwCPcBGAYYCw/s640/Captureygfyhfyhfhf.PNG)).  An increase in shortwave radiation of 3 W/m2 due to a decrease in  cloud-cover will lead to a net-warming of 1.2 W/m2. So, a decrease in  cloudiness is one possible explanation for global warming.

**10)  The mathematical  properties of the growth curves for human CO2-emissions and  atmospheric CO2 contents are unequivocal in showing that some source  other than the human one must be contributing significantly to the  atmospheric CO2 rise.**

Between  1990-2003 anthropogenic CO2-emissions were relatively stable — as  atmospheric CO2 accelerated  away from human emissions, which means that  some source other than  human emissions must be driving the  acceleration. That non-human source  is presently unidentified, but we  can tell that it must exist. Moreover  from 2003-2010  anthropogenic CO2-emissions accelerated while the  atmospheric CO2 growth-rate remained relatively flat. Hence there is a  definite mismatch (See graph below from [**Francey et al 2013**](https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate1817))

**11) The IPCC claim that the long life-time for atmospheric CO2 is  due to the Revelle Factor.** 

Regarding  the Revelle Factor, Bolin et al  1959 states: “Less than 10% of the  excess fossil CO2 in the atmosphere  should have been taken up by the  mixed-layer (or surface-ocean). It is  therefore obvious that the  mixed-layer acts as a bottleneck in the  transport of fossil  fuel CO2 to the deep-sea”. This bottleneck inhibiting the transport of  anthropogenic CO2 to the deep-ocean would appear to be at odds with  removal of anthropogenic 14CO2 from the atmosphere after the 1963+  nuclear test-ban treaty. These tests doubled the concentration  of 14CO2 in the atmosphere above its natural equilibrium concentration.  The observations show a half-life for 14CO2 of 10-12 years (See graph [**here**](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-6HYEWmdDVis/W9MCf5t32nI/AAAAAAAAJ4c/2UpthEhexuox7bh4gRbsIZfuqrM0nHnSgCLcBGAs/s1600/rabiit.PNG)).  Equilibration would therefore essentially be complete by 94% after 4  half-lives =  40-48 years. Considering that the combined amount of  carbon in the  soil, vegetation and surface-ocean is 3,400 gigatonnes  (according to the  IPCC) and the total amount of carbon in the  atmosphere is 800  gigatonnes then if such a bottleneck existed in the  surface-ocean, the  concentration of 14CO2 in the atmosphere would then  have stabilized at around 23% (i.e. 800/3400). With only around 4%  of 14CO2 remaining in the atmosphere today it implies that the 14CO2 has  become mixed with a reservoir 25 times larger than the amount of CO2 in  the atmosphere and the only place that much CO2 is  known to exist and  be in exchange with the atmosphere is in the  deep-oceans. Ergo, the  IPCC are wrong about the Revelle Factor causing a  bottleneck in the  surface-ocean.

**12) According to the** [**Arrhenius equation**](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-973QH3WVgiQ/W6Y6jn8MlpI/AAAAAAAAJek/q1imUyFI18Q-AShiFe_qT36qRiTKzrpfQCLcBGAs/s400/co2forcing%2B%25281%2529.PNG) **for calculating how CO2 catches heat the warming on Mars should be larger.** 

“The  Mars atmosphere is highly amenable to empirical testing of  Arrhenius’ equation  because its climate-system contains no real  significant  feedback-mechanisms to complicate or modify the direct and  immediate  response of the CO2 in terms of the amount of radiative  forcing that it is supposed to produce”. When the Arrhenius equation is  applied to  the planet of Mars things go horribly wrong. There the  observed global  warming (according to NASA’s revised Fact Sheet) is  about 0.2°K (or  about 0.5 W/m2). The revised NASA data shows an  effective temperature for Mars of 209.8°K (See [**NASA Mars Fact Sheet**](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-4i6jeX8OZHs/W6Em27RIOyI/AAAAAAAAJYk/1kZOvJ8RHCgifn56YDTRgM1YeBhZiADtgCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Capture1.PNG))  and an average global surface temperature of \~210°K. This is  interesting when one considers that Mars has a CO2 density approximately  27 times higher than on Earth — at 165 kg/m2 and 6 kg/m2 respectively  and on Earth CO2 is claimed to increase the global average surface  temperature by 6°K (or 32 W/m2). The CO2 on Mars apparently produces 30  times less warming despite being 27 times more abundant.

**13) The IPCC may have** [**overestimated**](http://notrickszone.com/50-papers-low-sensitivity/) **climate sensitivity.**

**14) Atmospheric CO2 has been shown to lag temperature-changes (See the graph** [**here**](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-zKbp5ZEkW9Q/W6FTE7sEXTI/AAAAAAAAJZ8/vf3E3T62fNQzZ-QLTtv8kAEWX8AYx2wygCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/UHUHUHUOH.png)**)\*\*\*\*.**

CAGW-advocates  claim that CO2 is driving global temperatures, yet CO2-changes are  lagging behind corresponding temperature-changes. Saying CO2 drives  temperature-changes is tantamount to saying that cancer causes  smoking. The cause-and-effect relationship is backwards. CO2 is trivial.

**15) The predictive performance of the CAGW-models have been completely refuted by real-world observations.**

The graph [**here**](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-QQGu8em0VdQ/W6FkwQXGPmI/AAAAAAAAJaw/1ADa9VUbBGkoEWYsqZjSfyfS3tfgSeBpwCPcBGAYYCw/s640/spencer-models-epic-fail2-628x353.jpg) (from  former NASA scientist Roy Spencer) shows that the IPCC’s models have  overestimated the tropospheric warming. The CAGW-models can be seen to  be irrational and represent the Earth’s climate system so poorly that  they can really only be described as misrepresentations of it. Quote  from Dr. Roy Spencer: “We  can see that 95% of the models have  over-forecast the warming trend  since 1979, whether we use their own  dataset (HADCRUT4) or our satellite  dataset of lower tropospheric  temperatures (UAH)”*.*

I have a genuine question for you all regarding what you’re thinking.,"Can I ask the people of this sub this? You claim there is an agenda of people trying to get us all to “pay more” by taking action on climate change (reducing emissions primarily), but do you ever think about the money that goes into sowing doubt about climate change?

Think about it. You have scientists and some fringe businesses vs every GHG emitting industry on Earth here. Do you seriously think there is a global conspiracy, only involving the world of science, when the far more reasonable viewpoint would be that the industries, that can afford to lobby governments all over the world might have a legitimate reason to make you all think nothing is wrong? 

These companies make actual money from being allowed to emit as much as they do. It costs money to change their course (not to mention involves actually giving a fuck), why do you think no polluting industry wants to? Not to mention, the businesses that want to replace these ones (solar panel manufacturers for instance) are typically longer term investments and don’t rely so much on ongoing income. 

And you look at the political parties that don’t want to do much about these things. Liberal Party of Australia. Backed by mining corporations, both publicly and not. And enjoyed the support of the majority of Australia’s media outlets. 

Clive Palmer even backed these guys, running scare campaigns and attack ads against Labor the entire election with the sole purpose of keeping Labor out. Even ran his party in all 150 seats just to funnel preferences to the Liberals. Election comes and goes, and look at that, Palmer is building a new coal mine in Queensland now. 

Might I add that Labor was running on a vague platform of stopping new coal mining and working toward fixing climate change. There is your actual proof that BIG money goes into convincing the public nothing is wrong with the climate (Palmer spent an estimated $60 million on his ad campaigns). 

Not that Labor is particularly hard on industries either. Backed by mining to a lesser extent, their policy was just 50% reduction in GHG emissions by 2030. Which, with renewables getting better by the day, is realistic. But did they ever get hammered in the media for it. 

Move to the Greens. Member funded (they do not accept corporate donations). Thought that Labor wasn’t going hard enough on climate issues. Opposes Adani’s 1500 job mine (which btw is definitely a significant figure. Queensland only had 10,000 people go unemployed in March alone). Hammered by EVERY media outlet I can think of, and ended up with one seat. Note the pattern here? Smaller the donations from mining, the more they want to do about climate change, and the more they get attacked for it. 

Did I mention the hammering Labor copped for the “carbon tax”? [Because the Liberal Party staffers responsible admitted they were full of shit.](https://www.sbs.com.au/news/carbon-tax-just-brutal-politics-credlin)

Just think who benefits from taking action (supposedly the “left”, a broad category of people that seems to include science and that’s about it), and who benefits from not taking action to reduce emissions (anyone who contributes to higher GHG levels: car manufacturers, coal mining, power generation, farming, any business that relies on clearing land and chopping down forestry, gasoline extractors, oil companies, I could go on).

So [here is today's example](https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/brag25/im_torn_between_being_hopeful_and_being_depressed/-)

&gt;  Does anyone else feel this way?
Most of the time I feel crushing anxiety and depression, and I live in a near-constant state of worry. I am afraid for the world we're leaving for our children, and I am so sad about the effects that global heating has already had on other countries (especially on the most vulnerable). I don't think people are doing enough, and I am pessimistic about our chances to combat imminent threat.
But....
Then, sometimes I try to focus on the positives: the amazing work being done to clean up our planet, the steps we are taking in the right direction, and the fact that IF we can stave off complete annihilation we will have made a world that I actually will want to live in. A world that isnt as greedy, or destructive, or hopeless... a world that puts the earth first, instead of our own selfish species.
I tend to oscillate between the two viewpoints lately, and I'm wondering if anyone else feels the same way?

Global Warming in the West,"We live on the Washington side of the Columbia Gorge, and decided to take a road trip to the national parks and monuments of southern Utah, by way of Ogden, Utah's celebration of the sesquicentennial of the ""Golden Spike"" that completed the first transcontinental railroad.

It was unseasonably cold in most places we went. Absolutely frigid in some of them. The landscape was beautifully and unusually green everywhere, owing to the heavy rain and snow that's fallen almost everywhere west of the Mississippi River except for the Puget Sound region of western Washington.

We are on the way home. Yesterday, we drove from Moab, Utah, which was cold, to Ely, Nevada, which was colder. We hit slush at near the intersection of I-70 and I-15, and awoke to sleet this morning. Now it's snowing, and we saw a Nevada DOT plow this morning. The scenic drive through Great Basin Nat'l Park was mostly closed yesterday due to snow. Today, we will drive to Lakeview, Oregon, in south-central Oregon just over the California border. It should be warm and dry there by now, but we expect it to be chilly and raining. They've had a lot of rain this year.

Remember the permanent California drought? Well, the state's reservoirs are almost full, and more rain and mountain snow is coming. None of what I am describing is unusual in the larger scheme. The West has always had a highly variable and volatile climate -- which is something that the global warming cultists would have known if they'd simply bothered to look at the records and crack open a history book. But no!

There was the permanent drought in Texas early in this decade, and then the permanent drought in California in mid-decade. All caused by global warming, and not the natural drought-drench cycles that characterize these places. When ""progressives"" coalesce around an egregious bullshit story, nothing will dislodge them.

"Who is benefiting from ""climate change"" ?","Hi everyone. I've been growing an interest for climate skepticism recently, and some thoughts occured to me.

If climate change is solely a product of media manipulation and has been falsified, who is pushing this narrative, and more importantly, why ?

Going against the big oil companies and corporations isn't in the best interest of the capitalist system. It is, in fact, a very anti-system thing to do. It means renouncing to that praised economic growth, and it's something governements and companies are not happy about. They made everything to make the environnemental measures have the lesser impact on economics, which often meant disrepecting them. 

It seems in fact that governements and corporations have bent to the pressure of environnemental issues only to to avoid a global and dangerous public dissatisfaction, not actually acting against ""climate change"" but only pretending. And so I have been wondering, who do you think is actually benefiting from the climate change agenda ?",climateskeptics

Still connecting the dots. This is likely to continue in the current sunspot minimum, possibly thru much of next year. No precise dates for the onset of Cycle #25 are being given. It often takes about 2-3 years INTO a new sunspot cycle to predict to about 95%  the size and duration of it. So, we have another year to wait for he onset of #25, or so.

However, as the cycles wane, &amp; it's complex system, thus not linear, most all estimates even 2-3 years into Cycle  #25 could be off, substantially. 

We'll see if Dr. Zharkova is right or not, and to what degree in between.

Common sense would dictate that in a round about way we could quite easily and affordably fill places like Australia, China and Africa with forests. Seeds are cheap and essentially it is a single one time investment. The labour would take no more than a couple years reduced if we aerial seed and within a decade or two of growth we'd almost double our absorption.

Why don't we do this?

Obviously because anthropogenic climate change is a money making scam. If we simply threw small amounts of money at it and planted forests we'd essentially break even our Co2 output and hence stop the perceived problem.

Instead all they recommend is related to technology, buy solar, buy wind, buy EV's, buy new efficient houses, buy battery storage, buy buy buy, tax tax tax. Those are the only solutions they push. 

Interesting.

And whenever they do discuss forests its almost always about deforestation and how bad it is and the very little times they ever do speak of reforestation there are always reasons to not do it, but this and but that. Its all bollocks.

Hemp (sure not the best absorber) can grow from seed to fully grown in 12 weeks, its a robust plant that you pretty much scatter and you'll have a hemp forest in no time. Pine trees are excellent absorbents of Co2 you can literally buy bags of seeds which will reforest a small area for a few hundred dollars. BOLLOCKS I tell ya!",climateskeptics

The climate is noticeably changing. It's getting colder.

-

Pre-emptively let's get some good posts and overviews on the general reasons for skepticism so when you reference Climategate, or global cooling, there are some sources to state rather than (falsely) assuming newcomers and lurkers are aware of such arguments 

The narrative shills will try to paint will be something like ""hurr durr I'm a dumb redneck I don't trust science"", and that needs to be countered 

Now then
-

Let me start with some examples of fake news around climate change: here's an archive from March 4th 1970: the idea of a ""man-made, life destroying ice age"" while wasting all of the publics attention on it, while ignoring the f-cking Ozone layer and very real (but hard to observe) CFC's, because [these idiots were obsessed on pushing bureaucratic fuel controls](https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=qvcNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=_3sDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5498,3270345)


&gt;""The possibility of a new
man-made, life-destroying ice
age was reported by the Environmental Science Services
Administration (ESA). It
quoted Dr. Earl W. Barrett of
the ESSA Research Laboratories, Boulder, Colo., as saying
the planet's total environment
""is being altered, perhaps
disastrously and irreversibly,
by human activities.""
addressed International War Energy Conference
yesterday in Melbourne,
Australia. He based his conclusions on actual measurements of particular pollutants such as smoke and dust and on calculations
stemming from them. particles suspended In
the atmosphere affect the
amount of sunlight reaching
the Earth's surface. Such
particles spewed from volcanoes
may have caused the great ice ages of the
geologic past.""


And these same idiots kept all the attention on fuels.

It was only by ACCIDENT someone paid attention to the Ozone layer and non-fuel-based pollutants, and so (ironically) there WAS a massive environmental risk at the time but not with ""global cooling"", the risk was with with the Ozone layers destruction, which no one [paid attention to because the idiots were all pushed to focus on transportation fuels](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/ozone-hole-was-super-scary-what-happened-it-180957775/):

&gt;...Even as researchers began to study ozone levels over time, they started to think about whether it was capable of being depleted. **By the 1970s, they were asking how emissions from things like supersonic aircraft and the space shuttle, which emitted exhaust directly into the stratosphere, might affect the gases at that altitude.**

&gt;But it turned out that contrails weren’t the ozone layer’s worst enemy—the real danger was contained in things like bottles of hairspray and cans of shaving cream. In 1974, a landmark paper showed that chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) used in spray bottles destroy atmospheric ozone. The discovery earned Paul Crutzen, Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland a Nobel Prize, and all eyes turned to the invisible layer surrounding Earth.

&gt;But what they found shocked even scientists who were convinced that CFCs deplete ozone. Richard Farman, an atmospheric scientist who had been collecting data in Antarctica annually for decades, thought his instruments were broken when they began to show drastic drops in ozone over the continent. They weren’t: The ozone layer had been damaged more than scientists could have imagined before Farman discovered the hole.



Also a more recent update, AFTER the Ozone [layer discovery](http://archive.is/S5kU6) and action, they completely flipped from ""cooling"" to ""warming"":



&gt;U.N. Predicts Disaster if Global Warming Not Checked
PETER JAMES SPIELMANN
Jun. 30, 1989


&gt;UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ **A senior U.N. environmental official says entire nations could be wiped off the face of the Earth by rising sea levels if the global warming trend is not reversed by the year 2000.**
Coastal flooding and crop failures would create an exodus of ″eco- refugees,′ ′ **threatening political chaos, said Noel Brown, director of the New York office of the U.N. Environment Program, or UNEP.
He said governments have a 10-year window of opportunity to solve the greenhouse effect before it goes beyond human control.**

&gt;As the warming melts polar icecaps, ocean levels will rise by up to three feet, enough to cover the Maldives and other flat island nations, Brown told The Associated Press in an interview on Wednesday.
Coastal regions will be inundated; one-sixth of Bangladesh could be flooded, displacing a fourth of its 90 million people. A fifth of Egypt’s arable land in the Nile Delta would be flooded, cutting off its food supply, according to a joint UNEP and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency study.
″Ecological refugees will become a major concern, and what’s worse is you may find that people can move to drier ground, but the soils and the natural resources may not support life. Africa doesn’t have to worry about land, but would you want to live in the Sahara?″ he said.

&gt;UNEP estimates it would cost the United States at least $100 billion to protect its east coast alone.
Shifting climate patterns would bring back 1930s Dust Bowl conditions to Canadian and U.S. wheatlands, while the Soviet Union could reap bumper crops if it adapts its agriculture in time, according to a study by UNEP and the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis.

&gt;...**UNEP is working toward forming a scientific plan of action by the end of 1990, and the adoption of a global climate treaty by 1992**. In May, delegates from 103 nations met in Nairobi, Kenya - where UNEP is based - and decided to open negotiations on the treaty next year.
**Nations will be asked to reduce the use of fossil fuels, cut the emission of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases such as methane and fluorocarbons, and preserve the rain forests.**

And now they rebranded yet again to a vague and undefined ""climate change"", because ""global warming"" is getting too much criticism


Ozone is real, Acid rain is also real (but a separate issue), intensified wildfires in [California are real](https://np.reddit.com/r/climateskeptics/comments/ap73qt/david_rothschild_explains_what_causes_wildfires/) (and have absolutely nothing to do with climate issues, they are caused by idiots)",climateskeptics

Clouds keep out heat and keep in heat. The rough ball park figure for the effect of H2O is 100 times that of CO2. However the effect of H2O varies quite considerably. A 25% variation in CO2 corresponds to a 0.25% variation of H2O. ie. if there is an increase or decrease in cloud cover of 0.25% that corresponds to an increase to 500PPM, or a decrease to 300PPM of CO2. The amount of cloud cover is constantly varying and as such makes any increase in CO2 in the order of 100PPM or more completely meaningless and irrelevant.",climateskeptics

CLIMATE CHANGE HOAX

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Maurice Newman was australian prime ministers chief business adviser. In 2015 he wrote an article in an Australian Newspaper stating that “Climate change is a ruse led by the united Nations to create a new world order”.

&amp;#x200B;

Maurice Newman continues and says that the new world order will be run by the United Nations. UN uses false models which show sustained temperature increase because it wants to end democracy and impose authoritarian rule.

&amp;#x200B;

“UN WANTS A NEW WORLD ORDER”

&amp;#x200B;

“It’s a well-kept secret, but 95 percent of the climate models we are told prove the link between human CO2 emissions and catastrophic global warming have been found, after nearly two decades of temperature stasis, to be in error. The real agenda is concentrated political authority. Global warming is the hook. UN is against capitalism and wants to create a new world order”.

&amp;#x200B;

This statement was done when UN climate chief Christiana Figueres visited Australia. Newman says that Figueres had also said:

&amp;#x200B;

“Democracy is a poor political system for fighting global warming. Communist China is the best model”.

&amp;#x200B;

Christine Figueres was in Australia and promoted Australia to move away from heavily polluting coal production.

&amp;#x200B;

Australian prime minister Abbott says that the Paris summit would fail if world leaders decided prioritize the cutting of carbon emissions over economic growth. Abbott have called the science behind climate change for “crap”. He has also repealed a tax carbon pricing .",climateskeptics

How do we know that climate change is occuring and we didn't just accidentally forget to count some calender days?,"I'll explain. What if over the past hundred years we skipped two weeks of calender days? For example, let's say on June 20, 1950 we all collectively forgot to mark out calenders and put our calender on a one day delay. This could be forgetting to mark calenders, all of us being asleep for some reason, etc. This seems that it would be a rare occurance, but over one hundred years we could have accumulated two weeks of uncounted calender days putting our calender right now on a two week delay.

This would make all the seasons start and end earlier which would give us the feeling that the climate is changing, when in reality our calenders have just been accumulating longer delays. We could also have accidentally skipped over days which would make seasons start and end later. Either skipping over or forgeting to count calender days could hypothetically make us think that the climate is changing and I have never heard a climate scientist address this point.",climateskeptics

The Greenhouse Gas That Matters,"Based on physical chemistry and biochemistry we could double our present use of fossil fuel and we would NOT see an increase in atmospheric CO2.......we would only see earth’s total biomass greenery grow faster and larger. CO2 is the fertilizer of life. That is not a problem.  Yes it is a greenhouse gas; however,  its concentration is much too low  to have any significant impact on earth’s heat retention. 

800 ppmv CO2 Greenhouse effect is negligible compare to 40,000 ppmv water vapor (at the equator).  Atmospheric water vapor concentrations is at least 200 ppmv at the polar regions and  increase rapidly in concentration as you move towards the equator.   

You can actually see the amount of atmospheric greenhouse water vapor that occurs in your area. Any rain you witness in your area came directly  from water vapor that condensed into clouds in your area.....that rain came directly from clouds that become too heavy to remain airborne! 

Rain is former greenhouse gas falling from the skies. 

Our planets stay warm 97% due specifically to water vapor......not CO2!!     Water vapor is the only greenhouse gas of concern.  The population has been brainwashed to believe CO2 is a problem.  It is not. 

Think about this:

ALL deserts get cold at night  because there is no water vapor in the air to keep the heat trapped close to the ground. That same dry air will contain 200 ppmv of CO2.........which is not nearly enough to keep heat trapped in the nighttime desert air.  Lack of water vapor alone is what allows desert air to get cold at night.

Rain is USED greenhouse gas falling from the sky and on the way to be recycled and rejuvenated.  We bear witness to this magnificent event.

Productive Poor People: Biggest Victims Of the Carbon Tax Scam., ,climateskeptics
I’m new here,"A little background:  I have a BS in environmental science (I know) and am in school for a BS in CS currently.  I consider myself libertarian.

I’m here because I think that anthropogenic climate change is being used as a political issue and as a result there is a lot of alarmism replacing good science.  I do think that humans have an impact in the greenhouse effect, but I’m skeptical as to the time line.  

I do think that immediate, more localized environmental issues are a problem like air pollution and chemical runoff into water sources.  I also think the data on oceanic acidification is pretty solid and can be directly related to Increased atmospheric carbon being sequestered in bodies of water.  

What is the general consensus of the sub on these things?  I haven’t seen much counter argument to the narrative and I am curious to see what errors people can point out in the various studies and reports so I can have a more sophisticated understanding of what is really going on.",climateskeptics

"A real question for skeptics, not an argument.","I’ve been checking out this sub because I want to see the other side of the climate change debate. I want to give myself a chance to challenge what I’ve long accepted as “truth.” 

In asking people this question, I’m often drawn into debate by hostile skeptics who think I’m too stupid for not being able to figure it out for myself. They set me up by asking me questions, and then debunking my answers, while my original question is left unanswered.  Honestly, that’s what I’m expecting now...  a bunch of downvotes, hostility, and insults. If it becomes too toxic, I will just delete it. 

Hopefully, someone can see this as a real question, and not an arrogant challenge to your beliefs. 

My question is this:

Why do you not accept the stated findings of the scientific community? 

So many scientific organizations state that climate change is real and caused by human activity. 

It seems that the vast majority of scientists accept this conclusion. Why are they wrong? Or why do you choose to not believe them? 

Edit: I removed a part of my original post where I explained my reason for asking this question, as well as the reasons why I accept the conclusions of the scientific community. I felt that it was argumentative, which I am trying to avoid.",climateskeptics

We’re in a carbon drought.

That is according to Professor William Happer of Princeton University. The renowned physicist says when it comes to carbon dioxide, there’s more good than bad. He goes on to say most of carbon dioxide’s effect has already happened. He points to the logarithmic dependence of temperature on carbon dioxide levels.

Happer says the unique properties of carbon dioxide mean that current levels would need to double for another one-degree increase in temperature and they’d have to double again for another one degree rise.

Atmospheric CO2 concentrations are ALWAYS driven by temperature.....,"Atmospheric CO2 concentrations are ALWAYS driven by temperature.  Equilibriums that occur at ANY temperature are effectively buffered at that particular temperature by earth’s total organic biomass and dictates of Henry’s Gas law which governs CO2 solubility in earth’s’ waters. 

Try doubling atmospheric CO2 concentration by increasing  emissions from any man caused event  and you will utterly fail.  It cannot be done!  That’s right... it cannot be done!!  Earth’s total biomass and vast oceans and waters will prevent any increase in Atmospheric CO2 CONCENTRATION. 

CO2 gas tonnage MOVEMENT through the atmosphere will definitely increase; however,  the overall CO2 concentration WILL NOT increase!  Doubling our use of fossil fuels will have zero measurable corresponding increase in AGT.  Be happy for this!!!

What happens each spring as earth’s biomass reacts  suddenly and magnificently to a seasonal temperature increase is all the proof one should need to “see”” what I stated above is true and self evident. Remember that atmospheric CO2 does not change its concentration during that spring  time event..........even though a gazzion tons of CO2 moves through the atmosphere and gets immediately locked up in the springtime burst of new plant life........triggered by the seasonal increase in temperature.

The Current Sunspot Minimum: Update,"This article is very interesting because it's an update current conditions. Note that the sunspot minimum ca. 2008 reached a 100 years low. And the current sunspot minimum is on track to do much the same. But time will tell.

What this means about cosmic ray impact upon the earth is important, esp. for space &amp; airliner travel and satellites, is interesting too; and the declining solar wind lets more cosmic rays through, and its a sort of indirect, but reinforcing measure of a solar minimum.

The important point is what the current sunspot minimum is, because they created a new method which overcalls the sunspots by using Ca++ and H+ line images to augment the ""Visual Only"" sunspot recordings back to the 1600's or so. that results in a 20-30 sunspot number overcalling from the previous methods &amp; means that the historical records, unless corrected by that value, are overcalling sunspot numbers, as well.

So time will tell. If we down grade the current SN to historical methods, then we will see if the current minimum, which is approaching a 50 years minimum, is the case. And by downgrading it by that 20-30 SN factor, we can see if the current sunspot cycle is the same, more or less than the previous one.

Those are important data not being seen or reported by the solar observatories, and is critical to understanding our sun and the part it plays in global Warming AND Cooling.

Day Two At The Greenland Open, ,climateskeptics
Some points and arguments I thought of,"-Earth is 4.6 billion years old (4,600,000,000)
Humans have been around for approximately 200,00 years. The industrial revolution (the apparent start of anthropogenic CO2) started approximately 200 years ago from today.

-Primates arose, breathing the same levels of oxygen in similar climate around 85-55 million years ago. But with more co2.

-This means anthropogenic CO2 has only been around for 0.000004347826086956522% of the planet’s timeline 
Or 0.0003636363636363636% of the time since primates arose (using the 55 million liberal estimate).
Or 0.1% of the time since home sapiens came to be.

-Humans apparently emit 38.2 billion tons of CO2 by the burning of fossil fuels (very liberal estimate)
The total CO2 natural planetary output AKA “the carbon cycle – slow and fast” is approximately 700-1000 billion tons but noone really knows. You can google this till your eyeballs are dried out and you will struggle to find the answer, you'll then struggle to confirm the answer and eventually you'll struggle to find out how they came up with the answer. Even “climate scientists” from NASA, IPCC and the EPA find these figures hard to gauge.
This means human output is only 3.8% of the total known output or in other words the natural output is 96.2% 
Of the total co2 that is output the oceans and plants soak up about 45% (including our own) which means that our 38.2 billion output is almost halved to about 20 billion tons.
This means our total atmospheric, non-absorbed co2 is closer to 2% of total co2 emitted
Estimates differ but it is said that volcanoes emit between 100 and 250 million tons of co2 per year.
All of the above equates to around 400ppm in the atmosphere or better put 0.04% And that is the TOTAL of both natural and man made co2. 
It is hard to gauge how much the total man made co2 in the atmosphere is after absorption for obvious reasons however in a vacuum if we look at the total atmosphere being 1 quadrillion that would equate to 0.0038000000000000004%
How exactly is any of this a problem?

-We are told this is a huge problem because our co2 output is cumulative as only some of it is stored naturally and the rest ends up in the atmosphere and it builds up which equates to basically all life on earth slowly boiling away or something end of world like... this is nothing more than a hypothesis and it assumes co2 output and absorption are constants which Is ridiculous as none of these are constants. If this was the case why have hominids and primates been able to exist on this planet for at a time of between 55-85 million years ago when at that very time there was co2 with between 1000-2000 ppm in the atmosphere? 

-back to the ""natural carbon cycle"" it assumes we are not part of the natural cycle. We are spoken about as if we are a kind of virus on the planet. Everything else that emits co2 other than humans is deemed perfectly natural but we humans are the problem in the narrative because of course we must be un-natural. This is again ridiculous and there is zero explanation for it. We are part of the planet. We are natural to it. It assumes the same, that our un-natural output is adding ""more"" co2, but of course that more is only ever explained from a modem time perspective. Believers don't like looking back in time further than the late 1700's.

-climate believers behave as if we are living in the end times, they use alarmist language and essentially it comes across as a wild conspiracy theory. When you tell them they are conspiracy theorists they really don't know how to respond because they aren't used to it. The fact is most of them don't actually believe most of the alarmist garbage themselves it's just comfortable for them to go with the flow but as soon as you call them conspiracy theorists which is what they really are, they get very defensive because they've never thought about this way. One addition to this is asking them if they are completely off-grid and if they have devoted 100% of their waking life to reversing the end times, naturally they say no to which I usually make them confirm if they believe like their comrades do that the world is going to end, by this point most will never return a reply and the ones that do usually try to change the subject because they are realising how silly what they believe is. 

-pollution and co2 output are completely different topics that the believers constantly confuse. Once you tell them your not for pollution, plastic in the ocean is bad, chemicals and pollutants in our air and water are dangerous etc it disarms them to a degree. Most of them have never considered climate sceptics are just as concerned about polluting as the rest of humanity. We all want clean air, water and food. Co2 is not a pollutant. They different topics. Don't ever let a believer conflate the bees with co2. 

-Humans. Time and self destruction. Humans don't have a self destructive program as a collective. Let's say the believers are correct and we've fucked things up. Well let's take a step back. We need to think not on our time scale but on the planets. 200 years is a blip on the planetary time scale. The last one hundred thousand years is part of the last tenth of a second in the planetary clock to midnight and we're led to believe we have made a mess but in that same tiny tiny tiny  frame of time we are correcting it. We've got solar, wind, hydro, Nuclear, it's the topic of discussion constantly, we've created atmospheric carbon cleaners, carbon store injection systems, plastic eating bacteria, we're putting a man on Mars for Pete's sake, we have both super and quantum computers, AI...Guys, I'm pretty sure we're looking after the problem..were the apex predator for a reason.",climateskeptics

**- Club of Rome**  


**The First Global Revolution** The environmental movement has been described as the largest and most influential social phenomenon in modern history. From relative obscurity just a few decades ago it has spawned thousands of organisations and claims millions of committed activists. Reading the newspaper today it is hard to imagine a time when global warming, resource depletion, environmental catastrophes and 'saving the planet' were barely mentioned. They now rank among the top priorities on the social, political and economic global agenda.

Environmental awareness is considered to be the mark of any good honest decent citizen. Multi-national companies compete fiercely to promote their environmental credentials and 'out-green' each other. The threat of impending ecological disasters is uniting the world through a plethora of international treaties and conventions. But where did this phenomenon come from, how did it rise to such prominence, and more importantly, where is it going?

While researching for these articles, and during my academic studies, I have come across many references to the [The Club of Rome](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/www.clubofrome.org/) (CoR), and reports produced by them. Initially I assumed that they were just another high-level environmental think-tank and dismissed the conspiracy theories found on many websites claiming that the CoR is a group of global elitists attempting to impose some kind of one world government.

I am not a conspiratorial person by nature and was faced with a dilemma when I first read their reports. But it's all there - in black and white. The CoR claims that ""*we are facing an imminent catastrophic ecological collapse*"" and ""*our only hope is to transform humanity into a global interdependent sustainable society, based on respect and reverence for the Earth*."" In the end I came to the conclusion that there are two possibilities – either the CoR wrote all these reports and setup a vast network of [supporting organisations](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/www.green-agenda.com/greenweb.html) just for fun **or** they actually believe what they have written and are working hard to fulfill their role as the self-appointed saviours of Gaia.

Based on my close observation of their actions, and watching the recommendations made by the CoR many years ago now being adopted as official UN and government policy – well, I have become personally convinced that they are deadly serious. On this website I try to use quotes and excerpts as much as possible and let the reader reach their own conclusions.

So, what exactly is the Club of Rome and who are its members?

# Founded in 1968 at David Rockefeller’s estate in Bellagio, Italy, the CoR describes itself as ""a group of world citizens, sharing a common concern for the future of humanity."" It consists of current and former Heads of State, UN beaureacrats, high-level politicians and government officials, diplomats, scientists, economists, and business leaders from around the globe.

The Club of Rome subsequently [founded](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/www.fondamental.com/en/eclub2.htm) two sibling organizations, the [Club of Budapest](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/www.clubofbudapest.org/index.php) and the [Club of Madrid](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/www.clubmadrid.org/). The former is focused on social and cultural aspects of their agenda, while the latter concentrates on the political aspects. All three of these 'Clubs' share many common members and hold [joint meetings](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/www.fondamental.com/en/eclubbud.htm) and [conferences](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/www.gfna.net/eventdetail.php?id=14&amp;). As explained in other articles on this website it is abundantly clear that these are three heads of the same beast. The CoR has also established a network of 33 [National Associations.](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/www.clubofrome.org/eng/national_associations/addresses.asp) Membership of the 'main Club' is limited to 100 individuals at any one time. Some members, like Al Gore and Maurice Strong, are affiliated through their respective National Associations (e.g. [USACOR](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/www.usacor.org/), [CACOR ](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/www.cacor.ca/)etc).

I would like to start this analysis of the Club of Rome by listing some prominent members of the CoR and its two sub-groups, the Clubs of Budapest and Madrid. Personally it isn’t what the CoR is that I find so astonishing; it is **WHO** the CoR is! This isn’t some quirky little group of green activists or obscure politicians. They are the most senior officials in the United Nations, current and ex-world leaders, and the founders of some of the most influential environmental organisations. When you read their reports in the context of who they are – its gives an entirely new, and frightening, context to their extreme claims.

**Some current members of the Club of Rome or its two siblings:**

[**Al Gore**](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/06/05/1942343.htm) – former VP of the USA, leading climate change campaigner, Nobel Peace Prize winner, Academy Award winner, Emmy winner. Gore lead the US delegations to the Rio Earth Summit and Kyoto Climate Change conference. He chaired a meeting of the full Club of Rome held in Washington DC in 1997.

[**Javier Solana**](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/www.consilium.europa.eu/cms3_applications/applications/solana/cv.asp?cmsid=246&amp;lang=EN) – Secretary General of the Council of the European Union, High Representative for EU Foreign Policy.

***and many more….***

The concept of 'environmental sustainability' was first brought to widespread public attention in 1972 by the Club of Rome in their book entitled [*The Limits to Growth*](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limits_to_Growth). The official summary can be read [here](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/www.clubofrome.org/docs/limits.rtf). The report basically concluded that the growth of the human population, and an increase in prosperity, would cause an ecological collapse within the next hundred years:

“*If the present growth trends in world population, industrialization, pollution, food production, and resource depletion continue unchanged, the limits to growth on this planet will be reached sometime within the next one hundred years. The most probable result will be a rather* ***sudden and uncontrollable decline*** *in both population and industrial capacity*.”

“***It is possible to alter these growth trends*** *and to establish a condition of ecological and economic stability that is sustainable far into the future. The* ***state of global equilibrium could be designed*** *so that the basic material needs of each person on earth are satisfied and each person has an equal opportunity to realize his individual human potential*.”

“*The overwhelming growth in world population caused by the positive birth-rate loop is a recent phenomenon, a result of mankind's very successful reduction of worldwide mortality.* ***The controlling negative feedback loop has been weakened***\*, allowing the positive loop to operate virtually without constraint. There are only two ways to restore the resulting imbalance. Either the birth rate must be brought down to equal the new, lower death rate, or\* ***the death rate must rise again***.”

“***The result of stopping population growth in 1975 and industrial capital growth in 1985*** *with no other changes is that population and capital reach constant values at a relatively high level of food, industrial output and services per person. Eventually, however, resource shortages reduce industrial output and* ***the*** ***temporarily stable state degenerates***.”

“*Man possesses, for a small moment in his history, the most powerful combination of knowledge, tools, and resources the world has ever known. He has all that is physically necessary to* ***create a totally new form of human society*** *- one that would be built to last for generations. The two missing ingredients are a realistic, long-term goal that can* ***guide mankind to the equilibrium society*** *and the Human Will to achieve that goal*.”

“*Without such a goal and a commitment to it, short-term concerns will generate the exponential growth that drives the world system toward the limits of the earth and* ***ultimate collapse***\*. With that goal and that commitment,\* ***mankind would be ready now to begin a controlled, orderly transition from growth to global equilibrium***.”

So as you can see the even back in 1972 the Club considered modern industrial society to be completely unsustainable. They state that even if population was frozen at 1975 levels, and industrial activity at 1985 levels, then the earth’s ecosystems would still ultimately collapse. The CoR has not changed these views in the slightest, in fact, in the last three decades their warnings have become increasingly more urgent and alarmist. They call this imminent collapse the ‘[World Problematique](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/www.clubofrome.org/about/world_problematique.php)’ and their proposed solution the ‘[World Resolutique](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/www.uia.be/en/node/159?kap=24).’

The *Limits to Growth* is considered to be the most successful environmental publication ever produced and propelled the Club of Rome to its current position of an environmental thought-leader and a major consultant to the United Nations. It has been translated into more than forty languages and sold more than 30 million copies. Throughout the 1970s and 80s the concept that humanity was irreparably damaging the earth gained popularity and facilitated the formation of mainstream and activist environmental groups.

All meetings of the CoR are held ‘behind closed doors’ and no public records are kept. However the Club does produce many ‘[discussion reports](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/www.clubofrome.org/archive/reports.php)’ that can be found on its website. The United Nations [contracts](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/erc.unesco.org/ong/en/directory/ONG_Desc_portal.asp?mode=gn&amp;code=908) the Club of Rome to prepare ‘Policy Guidance Documents’ which it uses in formulating its policies and programmes. A quick search for Club of Rome on the [UNESCO publications](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/unesdoc.unesco.org/ulis/cgi-bin/ulis.pl?database=&amp;mode=e&amp;set=47F6CA01_2_151&amp;tx_d=1&amp;look=new&amp;sc1=1&amp;sc2=1&amp;lin=1&amp;nl=1&amp;gp=1&amp;ll=1&amp;scroll=1) site reveals 250 such documents. There are many other documents there authored by CoR members acting in other capacities. As many high ranking UN officials are actually CoR members, this is like a man asking himself for advice, and then agreeing with that advice. Not very objective! Various UN organisations also hold [joint conferences](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=18127&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html) with the CoR.

While checking the Club of Rome website this morning the first item in their ‘current news’ section refers to a briefing delivered by the [CoR to G8 officials ](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/www.clubofrome.org/eng/g8plus5/)in preparation for the upcoming G8 meeting. The second item is a summary report from the Club of Romes ’[strategy planning retreat](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/www.clubofrome.org/eng/cor_news_bank/12/)’ with 150 senior UNESCO officials. The joint CoR/UNESCO communique states:

“*We are at the end of an era – a turning point in history. We are approaching the threshold of runaway climate change.* ***We underline the urgency of radical action to reduce emissions***\*, by both immediate action and longer-term measures; to stress to political leaders the non-linear nature of the processes at work which will generate sudden change; and to assert that the overriding priority must be to avert the impending risk of catastrophic climate change.\*” - CoR/UNESCO communique

Twenty years after the *Limits to Growth* the CoR published another major report that became an instant best-seller. In *The First Global Revolution* the Club of Rome claimed that the time to act had run out. It was now or never. Delay in beginning corrective measures will increase the damage to the world ecological system and ultimately reduce the human population that will eventually be supportable. They also stated that democratic governments are far too short-sighted to deal with the ‘problematique’ and new forms of governance are urgently required.

In order not too violate any copyright protection I will not reproduce the text of the book on this site. However, it is permissible for me to quote a brief excerpt in the context of this wider discussion. The complete [text](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/books.google.com/books?id=8RNKHGbzUuAC&amp;printsec=frontcover) (third ed.) can be read and searched online at Google Books. As you read the following quote (from page 75, first ed.), please remember the names of the leaders listed above. This is not some quirky little cult. This is the [stated agenda ](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/green-agenda.com/index.html)of the leaders of the environmental movement:

“***This is the way we are setting the scene for mankind’s encounter with the planet***\*. The opposition between the two ideologies that have dominated the 20th century has collapsed, forming their own vacuum and leaving nothing but crass materialism.\*

*It is a law of Nature that any vacuum will be filled and therefore eliminated unless this is physically prevented. “Nature,” as the saying goes, “abhors a vacuum.” And people, as children of Nature, can only feel uncomfortable, even though they may not recognize that they are living in a vacuum.* ***How then is the vacuum to be eliminated?***

*It would seem that humans need a common motivation, namely* ***a common adversary***\*, to organize and act together in the vacuum; such a motivation must be found to bring the divided nations together to face an outside enemy,\* ***either a real one or else one invented for the purpose***\*.\*

*New enemies therefore have to be identified.*  
*New strategies imagined, new weapons devised.*

&amp;#x200B;

# ""The common enemy of humanity is man.""

&amp;#x200B;

***In searching for a new enemy to unite us, we came up with the idea that pollution, the threat of global warming, water shortages, famine and the like would fit the bill.*** *All these dangers are caused by human intervention, and it is only through changed attitudes and behavior that they can be overcome.* ***The real enemy then, is humanity itself.***

*The old democracies have functioned reasonably well over the last 200 years, but they appear now to be in a phase of complacent stagnation with little evidence of real leadership and innovation*

***Democracy is not a panacea***\*. It cannot organize everything and it is unaware of its own limits. These facts must be faced squarely. Sacrilegious though this may sound,\* ***democracy*** ***is no longer well suited for the tasks ahead***\*. The complexity and the technical nature of many of today’s problems do not always allow elected representatives to make competent decisions at the right time.\*”

So, long before Global Warming became a well known issue Al Gore and his Club of Rome colleagues stated that they would use the threat of global warming to unite humanity and ""*set the scene for mankind's encounter with the planet.*"" In the same way that shamans and sooth-sayers in medieval times used their advance knowledge of when eclipses would occur to control and terrify their followers, they would use a natural phenomenon as their 'enemy' to achieve their objectives. But then they state that although Global Warming would be presented as the initial enemy, the real enemy of humanity would be portrayed as man himself. I am already noticing how frequently the terms climate change and overpopulation are being uttered in the same breath.

Having discovered that all these influential environmental leaders were associated with the Club of Rome I set about reading all the reports, lectures and speeches on their website as well as the reports commissioned by the UN. I was amazed to find that they lay out their entire agenda for anyone who has eyes to see. Exactly the same themes, concepts and phrases are repeated continuously throughout their publications. They are full of references to '*imminent collapse*', '*dying planet*', '*our mother Gaia*', '*wrenching transformation*', '*united global society*', '*global consciousness*', '*new forms of governance*' etc. They truly intend to bring about the world's *First Global Revolution*.

The [Kosmos Journal ](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/www.kosmosjournal.org/kjo2/about/partners/index.shtml)provides perhaps the best insight into their worldview. This Journal was founded by the Club of Rome in partnership with with several of its sibling organizations. As described in my article, [The Green Web](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/green-agenda.com/greenweb.html), the CoR has established a network of supporting organizations, each focusing on a different aspect of their agenda. The Kosmos Journal contains many articles written by CoR members. The basic premise of their worldview is:

*""Modern industrial civilisation is fast outstripping the Earth's natural regenerative and life-supporting capacity...""*

*""At current rates of resource depletion and environmental degradation a near complete collapse of ecological integrity will occur within the next 100 years...""*

*""Gaia, our Mother, who nutured humanity for countless millenia within her womb of evolution, is dying...""*

*“A small window of opportunity now exists to transform humanity into a sustainable global interdepedant society based on respect and reverence for Earth...""*

*""A radical change from the current trajectory is required, a complete reordering of global society...""*

*""Humans only truly unite when faced with a powerful external enemy...""*

*""At this time a new enemy must be found, one either real or invented for the purpose...""*

*""Democracy has failed us, a new system of global governance, based on environmental imperatives, must be implemented quickly...""*

When Obama was firmly ensconced in the White House the Club of Rome and its affiliates are swing into high gear. The CoR unveiled a new 3-year programme entitled [A New Path for World Development](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/www.clubofrome.org/eng/new_path/). The Club of Madrid has launched the [Road to Copenhagen](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/www.roadtocopenhagen.org/), a joint programme with the UN Environment Programme intended to facilitate a binding global climate change treaty in 2009. Perhaps most interesting is the [State of Global Emergency ](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/www.worldshiftnetwork.org/declaration/index.html)declared by the Club of Budapest in October 2008. The declaration states that we only have **four or five years** to prevent a total collapse of the Earth's ecosystems. To quote from the [document](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/www.worldshiftnetwork.org/media/downloads/declaration.pdf):

“*If we continue on our present unsustainable path,* ***by mid-century the Earth may become largely uninhabitable for human and most other forms of life***\*. Such a total systems collapse could occur much sooner, however, due to\* ***runaway global warming*** *or other ecocatastrophes, and/or by nuclear wars triggered by religious, ethnic or geopolitical conflicts or access to diminishing natural resources. The macro-trends driving these global threats and challenges have been apparent for decades and are now building toward a threshold of irreversibility. The scientific modeling of complex systems shows that when systems reach a state of critical instability, they either break down to their components or break through to a higher order of integral functioning. At these “****points of no return****” maintaining the status quo, or returning to a previous mode of organization and functioning, are not a feasible option.*

*The acceleration of critical trends and cross-impacts among them indicates that the ‘window of opportunity’ for pulling out of the present global crisis and breaking through to a more peaceful and sustainable world is likely to be* ***no more than four to five years*** *from the end of 2008.* ***This is close in time to the Mayan 2012 prophecy for the end of the current world***\*. The period around the end of 2012 is likely to be a turbulent one for this and other reasons. Predictions coming from the physical sciences foresee disturbances in the geomagnetic, electromagnetic and related fields that embed the planet causing significant damage to telecommunications and impacting many aspects of human activity and health.\* ***For the esoteric traditions the end of 2012 will be the end of the known world, although the more optimistic intepretations speak of a new world taking the place of the old***.”

This may seem very strange – a group of prominent world leaders talking about ancient Mayan prophecies, but as I describe in my article, [Gaia's Gurus](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/www.green-agenda.com/gaians.html), many leading global warming activists openly advocate earth-reverence and other New Age philosophies. **Gaia, Global Warming, and Global Governance** are intricately entwined, if one truly believes in Gaia, and that she is being fatally harmed by the current system, then a new system of global governance and control would appear to be the only answer. Global Warming provides the ideal 'enemy' to bring about this objective. It is easy for these global elitists to talk about sacrifice, wrenching transformation, population reduction and eliminating the use of fossil fuels but the implications are truely horrendous.

Even if you think this is all nonsense I would ask you to at least read [these quotes and excerpts](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/green-agenda.com/index.html), and think about the implications of their agenda. Everyday I am amazed at how quickly things are changing. It is coming hard and fast. It's almost like reading a book and then watching the television adaptation, except that this adaptation is not a movie - it's on the evening news. As Al Gore said in the closing sentence of his statement after he won the Nobel Peace Prize ... ""***This is just the beginning***.""

That's why the fertility rate table is littered with developing African nations, such as Angola, Burundi, Niger, Somalia, Burkina Faso, and so forth.

&gt;In fact, the first thirty four nations with the highest fertility rate are located in Africa. #35 is Iraq.

Again, on paper this seems ""edgy"" but it's not because Emmanual ""allyourmigrantsarebelongtous"" said [something similar](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/macron-scrutinized-for-blaming-africas-poverty-on-high-birthrate-23897)

&gt;...In response a question on Africa’s needs by a reporter at the G20 Summit July 7, Macron said, “it’s by a more rigorous governance, a fight against corruption, a fight for good governance, a successful demographic transition when countries today have seven or eight children per woman.”

To be clear, Macron is the most fanatical supporter of these [""bombshell"" birthrates](https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2018/04/17/macron-europe-migration-destiny-africa/)

&gt;‘Bombshell’ population growth in Africa means Europe is entering an “unprecedented” age of mass migration, Emmanuel Macron has said, asserting that the two continents’ destinies are “bound”.

And when I say this I mean 0 hate to people of African descent 

Macron isn't your friend, he doesn't want to empower you, he looks down on you and wants you as a subservient class that can be enslaved to an even more kleptocratic state, [nothing more](https://www.france24.com/en/20190122-italy-france-macron-salvini-dimaio-migrants-colonies-africa-libya)

&gt;Gloves off as Italy's populists mount assault on 'coloniser' France

&gt;...Officials in Paris have been getting used to the radical change of tone ushered in by the new populist and increasingly Eurosceptic government in Rome, generally greeting its provocations with a shrug and a sigh. But when Italy’s deputy prime minister, Luigi Di Maio, accused France of continuing to colonise Africa in a series of incendiary comments on Sunday, the provocation had gone too far for the French government, which summoned Italy’s ambassador in protest.

&gt;Di Maio, the leader of the anti-establishment Five-Star Movement, had called on the EU to “sanction France and all countries like France that impoverish Africa and make these people leave, because Africans should be in Africa, not at the bottom of the Mediterranean"". He added: ""If people are leaving today it's because European countries, France above all, have never stopped colonising dozens of African countries.""

Regardless, the reason I point that out is because I just can tell that the OP of that post is thinking about targetting demographically struggling nations (whether of the Western world, or the Oriental nations)

There is no need for ANYONE of any race to be targetted for genocide 

I tried to explain to this extremist how mass migration, etc, all must enable and exponentially worsen climate change, and yet this literally genocide inciting fellow [did not respond](https://np.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/bfjndp/this_planet_needs_a_genocide_and_it_would_be/elepgo5/)

Something Extraordinary with The Last Major Sunspot,"As many know there has been a singular, medium sized sunspot which started earlier this month in the high northern latitudes, which marked it as being sunspot cycle 24. As time went on, then it successively went further and further south, until it Crossed the equator and moved into the Southern hemisphere, very clearly!!!

By doing successive comparisons processing we can see this development, which creates information.

Now THAT is interesting &amp; NOT reported by NOAA. Which of itself is quite perplexing.

By reviewing the sequences of these images, starting about 15 April we can follow this sunspot as it migrates from higher northern sun latitudes to the equator and then very clearly, recently into the Southern latitudes.

Very odd!!!

Questions for skeptics,"So, i am too a skeptic of climate change and everything else in the world. But i have a few questions for the more informed of you.

Smog is caused by pollution and gasses from cars and other vehicles. So then we still have to fight for less usage of fossil fuels. And for more engines powered by electricity. 

And for Europeans especially, we get most of our oil from the middle east, and would rather have no dependence on that countries. So therefore its only good to have other forms of energy than oils.

My last question is, if humans have no effect or very little effect on climate change, who is benefiting from the rhetoric? Shell and other companies are one of the most wealthy companies ever. They dont want to lose their part.",climateskeptics

18th century philosopher Edmund Burke meditated on how extreme weather affected people emotionally,"He says a few things in this [short Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvzG_p_sdOQ) ([snapshot](https://i.imgur.com/VkaQLfa.jpg)) , starting with:

&gt;Normally we hate being made to feel small, we can't stand being humbled and reminded of our insignificance. We get affronted and resentful.

Burke thought these experiences could be quite important ... he called natural events that made people feel insignificant 'sublime'.   He argued big storms helped make people happier in the long run. Because

&gt;in comparison to a big storm the irritants of daily life seem less significant

my opinion is, being a skeptic and not trying the control the temperature of the planet to a fraction of a degree is healthy. As is being humbled by Nature.

Also in my opinion, being an climate alarmist often involves an unhealthy narcissism; That Burke was onto something relevant;  that some alarmists are a people wanting to avoid being humbled; Their intuition tells them to restrict weather as much as possible (not that they are going to, its just that they think they are), so other people won't be either.  They are shallow thinkers, to be sure.",climateskeptics

Humans contribute only 0.18% of the greenhouse effect,"I'm surprised that this info about the human contribution to the greenhouse effect is so little discussed. It seems this matter is controversial, because people are offering objections recently.

Well, let's settle this matter in this discussion. Previous discussion is already being redirected into a subthread because of the length.

Here I'm continuing from the previous discussion,
https://www.reddit.com/r/climateskeptics/comments/bdycrw/in_search_of_explanations/

the subthread is here,

https://www.reddit.com/r/climateskeptics/comments/bdycrw/in_search_of_explanations/el5lbmy/

This is what I originally said,

“Only 3.62 percent of the greenhouse gases is CO2. Of that amount, only 5% is emitted by human activity. So humans contribute only 0.18% of the greenhouse effect! This is so tiny that it's virtually invisible.”

Previously, I've given the following ref for my statement,

A Global Warming Primer - National Center for Policy Analysis
http://www.ncpathinktank.org/pdfs/Global-Warming-Primer-updated-reduced-size.pdf

But apparently this was challenged.

So here's my reply to user/Discoastermusicus reposted,

--------------

&gt; Nowhere does it say 3.62% of the greenhouse gases are CO2.

OK, now I have a better ref. Here it is,

https://www.geocraft.com/WVFossils/greenhouse_data.html

&gt; C02 is the second most abundant greenhouse gas if you include water vapor (https://cdiac.ess-dive.lbl.gov/pns/current_ghg.html), but it's misleading to give it as such a specific percentage, because water vapor in the atmosphere is very variable, ranging from 0.01-4.24%

Well, obviously we're talking about the averages here. On average that's how much it is.

&gt;Leaving aside the exact number, anthropogenic C02 emissions are indeed a small fraction of the total carbon flux on the planet

No, I'm not talking about ""the total carbon flux on the planet"". What I'm talking about is the total __greenhouse gas concentrations__.

Here's a quote from my new source,

https://www.geocraft.com/WVFossils/greenhouse_data.html

&gt;""Anthropogenic (man-made) CO2 additions comprise (11,880 / 370,484) or 3.207% of all greenhouse gas concentrations, (ignoring water vapor).""

You quoted further,

&gt;""The late-twentieth-century warming can only be reproduced in the model with anthropogenic forcing (mainly GHGs), while the early twentieth-century warming is mainly caused by natural forcing in the model (mainly solar)."" 

Well, there seems to be a bit of a contradiction here. So the early twentieth-century warming is caused by the sun, but the late-twentieth-century warming “can only be reproduced in the model with anthropogenic forcing”?

So where did the sun go? Did it suddenly decide to take a break in the late-twentieth-century? “I've had enough warming the earth, let the humans now do it!”

Doesn't seem to make much sense.

And just because your “model” says something, or doesn't say something – sorry, but this doesn't amount to much. So if your model refuses to cooperate, perhaps you should get yourself a different model that's closer to reality. There are lots of other models out there to choose from.",climateskeptics

Have I got this right - more Co2 means more heat is trapped each day?,"Greenhouse gas absorbs radiation from the sun.

The whole premise of global warming is that reflected radiation from the earth (land and sea) gets absorbed by Co2 and then re-radiated back down to earth, as well as heating the atmosphere. 

**Is this correct?** 

If so, then wouldn't the difference between the daily minimum and daily maximum be going down over time - as a trend? 

&amp;#x200B;

In other words, if we start with the minimum temperature at say around 5,00am as the sun rises and rays start hitting the earth, radiation gets absorbed. More Co2 will mean more heat is absorbed and re-radiated back. Therefore we should constantly be getting higher daily maximum temperatures, whilst minimums should remain the same. 

&amp;#x200B;

But, here's the problem - the minimums are going up as well.

&amp;#x200B;

With well over 40 years of data to analyse, it should be pretty easy to work out if more heat is being trapped each day. I know i could probably do it using a BI tool quite easily. 

**Have I missed something?**

Having worked with fitting simulators to online data professionally, the climate model approach irks me on many levels. 

1. there is no clear separation between tuninig and validation datasets. 

2. gisp2 data going back 10000 years indicate that the dominant natural climate cycle having a 1000 year period, fitting of models should ideally be to at least one full period, so 1000 years, not 50 years of data.

3. if the recent 50 years have been part of a natural warming cycle, models which do not describe the 1000 year cycle in its structure will when tuned to data of recent warming inadvertently have parameters that are ""colored"" to favor warming.

4. models seem too complex when the aim is to study the relation between gmt and co2, when there is essentially one model output and a handful of significant inputs, a 3D model whose code fills 18000 pages likely is overparametrized, which may give poorer prediction capabilities than a model with fewer parameters in general.

5. Climate models are surprisingly not automatically tuned (probably because they are too complex) This is a big red flag if true. 

6. Researchers know that models have structural errors, i. e. important observed phenomena are not described correctly, such as cloud formation, yet the model is still used as basis for policy.

7. Backtesting of data is often neglected, or the implication of poor backtest performance is not appreciated
8. A general disinterest in paleoclimate because models are too complex to backtest against sparse proxy data (then maybe your model is too complex?) 


Personally I would very much like to see much simpler lumped (1D) models attempt to describe co2 and temperature proxy data for the last 10000 years, and see what co2 sensitivity such models find,I would actually trust the predictions of such a model far more than the pseudoscience of current climate models. Anyone aware of any such studies? 

I would trust more a 3D-climate model that were able to describe natural variability in paleoclimate temperature proxies. Anyone aware of any such studies? 

Ideally I would appreciate an open discussion with someone knowledgeable in the field, but I fear that practicioners are too invested in their method to be able to review it critically, and that anyone not working in the field will be subject to gatekeeping.

- listed first is [a study](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2018PA003508) about attempts to model the (North) North Atlantic over the last 2000 years.  Recently there have been a series of papers about proxies there, included off of Greenland. I looked at one (Kolling et al, 2017), about sea ice, which banded in their graphs the 'Roman Warm Period, Dark Ages Cold Period, Medieval Climate Anomaly [yup!] and Little Ice Age'. Which they had to do because those were obviously in the sediment. ie in the proxies.  Not to mention a clear 74 year cycle. Remember, Arctic sea ice is one of their babies and they pretend 1979-2012 has nothing to do with the AMO etc. ... So anyway, the abstract of this modeling summary paper has ""*with a specific focus on the dynamical changes that are not well inferred from the proxy records*"".. does 'not well inferred' mean 'not in the proxy records'? Count me skeptical 

- another link is to AGU [coverage](https://eos.org/articles/planetary-low-tide-may-force-regular-sunspot-sync-ups) of the planetary/sunspot model!  Notice the headline has to beg ""no, it's not pseudoscience'. As I have  posted before the mainstream has resisted this since the 1950s.

The British perspective.,"How the BBC exaggerate man-made global warming in the David Attenborough propaganda program!!

Even the IPCC admits that man-made warming in the last 70 years is only 0.3° C !!!!



Last year, the BBC issued guidelines instructing editors that inviting comment from ‘climate change deniers’ was ‘false balance’. In practice, this has meant that those who accept climate change is real, but less threatening than some such as Attenborough claim, have effectively been banished from the airwaves.
Now the Corporation has given acres of airtime to protesters demanding the overthrow of democratic governments and an almost immediate end to fossil fuel-derived power, heating and transport – in other words, the abrupt termination of civilisation as we know it.
Thunberg has become a global media darling, her pronouncements cherished as if they were holy writ. 
‘I want you all to panic,’ she told the Davos economic forum in January: and Attenborough’s film may well have persuaded viewers to do just that – and, perhaps, to join the Extinction Rebellion barricades. 

Watching it did fill me with horror, but not at the threat from global warming. It was at the way Sir David and the BBC presented a picture of the near future which was so much more frightening than is justified.
Climate science remains a field riven by deep uncertainties. The film largely glossed over these – and where faced with alternatives, it plumped unerringly for the most pessimistic version of the ‘truth’.
Let me be clear: I am not a ‘denier’. Global warming and climate change are real, in large measure caused by humans. According to the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), our emissions were responsible for more than half the 0.6C – 0.7C global average temperature rise recorded between 1951 and 2010.
But I am also convinced that the ‘panic’ Thunberg desires and Attenborough’s film will encourage is not helpful when it comes to making policy designed to tackle it. Moreover, it is a grotesque travesty of the truth to claim that ‘nothing’ has been done: for example, since 1990, UK emissions have fallen by 43 per cent, according to the Government’s Committee on Climate Change. Not only that, Government statistics say 56 per cent of our electricity came from low carbon sources in 2018, our last coal-fired power station will close in six years and the Government has pledged to ‘decarbonise’ electricity by 2030.
Above all, the Climate Change Act requires Britain to reduce its 1990 carbon emissions by no less than 80 per cent by the year 2050, making us the first major economy to make such a dramatic commitment. To say that ‘nothing’ has been done is as risible as it is dishonest.

The IPCC, regarded by mainstream scientists as the world’s most authoritative source, says there have been some changes, such as higher rainfall. But its Fifth Assessment Report, published in 2013, stated there are ‘no significant observed trends in global tropical cyclone frequency over the past century’. It added: ‘No robust trends in annual numbers of tropical storms, hurricanes and major hurricane counts have been identified over the past 100 years in the North Atlantic basin.’
A separate IPCC report last year said that cyclones in the tropics would in future be less numerous, although some would be stronger.
In 2014, a group of IPCC experts published a paper about flooding. So far, they said, ‘no gauge-based evidence has been found for a climate-driven, globally widespread change in the magnitude/frequency of floods.’
Another memorable segment of the film showed a father and son narrowly escaping from one of several devastating fires last year in California. These, too, were ascribed to global warming. Surprisingly, several recent scientific papers suggest that wildfires have been declining in recent years – even in California, where statistics gathered by the local agency, Calfires, says the number across the state has roughly halved since 1987, following a peak in the 1970s.
According to a study published by the Royal Society in 2016, ‘many consider wildfire as an accelerating problem’. In reality, however, says the study: ‘global area burned appears to have declined in past decades, and there is increasing evidence that there is less fire in the global landscape than centuries ago.’",climateskeptics

Long ago, but not far away...  
Thousands of millennia in the past, the air had plenty of CO2, and plants flourished. Many of them fell down and became coal. Other things happened, and carbon became rocks (especially chalk and limestone, made of [Ca(CO3)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_carbonate)) Yet other things happened, and [carbon became petroleum](https://np.reddit.com/r/AlternativeHypothesis/comments/a8bndq/fossil_fuel_a_fact_mistake_conspiracy_theory_or/).

&gt; No one disputes that human’s activities have helped to increase atmospheric CO2 concentration, and it should not be in dispute that plants and Gaia are 'thankful' that humans have done so. At 400 ppm, the planet is a safer place to be and will be even safer at 1000 ppm.

[CO2 Science Summary](http://www.co2science.org/subject/c/summaries/carbondioxide.php)  
&gt; There is little reason to believe that (air's CO2 concentration leading to catastrophic global warming) will ever occur... it is climate change that drives changes in the air's CO2 content and **not** *vice versa*; air temperature always rises first, followed by an increase in atmospheric CO2 some 400 to 1000 years later.

"""Climate Change"" is Bullshit. Human CO2 Emissions Have Little Effect on Atmospheric CO2"," 

The United Nations *Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change*   (IPCC) agrees human CO2 is only (approximately) 5 percent and natural  CO2 is 95 percent of the CO2 inflow into the atmosphere. The ratio of  human to natural CO2 in the atmosphere must equal the ratio of the  inflows. Yet IPCC claims human CO2 has caused all the rise in  atmospheric CO2 above 280 ppm, which is now 130 ppm or 32 percent of  today’s atmospheric CO2.

To cause the  human 5 percent to become 32 percent in the atmosphere,  the IPCC model  treats human and natural CO2 differently, which is impossible because  the molecules are identical. IPCC’s Bern model artificially traps human  CO2 in the atmosphere while it lets natural CO2 flow freely out of the  atmosphere.

By contrast, a simple  Physics Model treats all CO2 molecules the same, as it should, and shows  how CO2 flows through the atmosphere and produces a balance level where  outflow equals inflow. Thereafter, if inflow is constant, level remains  constant.

The Physics Model has only  one hypothesis, that outflow is proportional to level. The Physics Model  exactly replicates the 14C data from 1970 to 2014 with only two  physical parameters: balance level and e-time. The 14C data trace how  CO2 flows out of the atmosphere.

The  Physics Model shows the 14CO2 e-time is a constant 16.5 years. Other  data show e-time for 12CO2 is about 4 to 5 years. IPCC claims human CO2  reduces ocean buffer capacity. But that would increase e-time. The  constant e-time proves IPCC’s claim is false.

IPCC  argues that the human-caused reduction of 14C and 13C in the   atmosphere prove human CO2 causes all the increase in atmospheric CO2.   However, numbers show these isotope data support the Physics Model and   reject the IPCC model.

The Physics  Model shows how inflows of human and natural CO2 into the  atmosphere  set balance levels proportional to their inflows. Each balance level  remains constant if its inflow remains constant. Continued constant CO2  emissions do not add more CO2 to the atmosphere. No CO2 accumulates in  the atmosphere.

Present human CO2  inflow produces a balance level of about 18 ppm. Present natural CO2  inflow produces a balance level of about 392 ppm. Human CO2 is  insignificant to the increase of CO2 in the atmosphere.  Increased  natural CO2 inflow has increased the level of CO2 in the  atmosphere.

The Climate Change Agenda,"We all know that trying to connect anything to the Climate Change Agenda that has to do with power grabs or depopulation is just a wacky conspiracy theory, but hear me out and let's take a little walk on the wild side......

Every  day, in meetings at all levels of government, representatives of Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), planning groups, and federal agents surround elected representatives and insist that their policies have nothing to do with international agendas. They regularly publish reports and rail against anyone even mentioning the names Agenda 21 or the new Agenda 2030. “No, no, no,” they insist. “Those people are just  crazy conspiracy theorists. Ours is just a local plan for our community.”

Elected Representatives are often confused. Issues and policies suddenly appear in front of them with sample, ready-made  legislation. And then the unending pressure begins for them to pass it. There is confusion, uncertainty and there is the herd mentality to pass legislation. And it’s passed without knowledge of its origins, its  purpose, and especially a lack of understanding of its consequences.  

What most of these legislators fail to understand is the direct  relationship much of this legislation has with a much larger agenda.  Most legislation interconnects with other pieces and parts contained in other legislation. 

&amp;#x200B;

### I. Global Warming/Climate Change

It has been so discredited in the true scientific community that proponents have become almost hysterical in their continued attempts to enforce Climate Change policy. Most recently the Justice Department is considering legal action against “deniers.”  Why don’t they stop, even to question if their science is sound? They instead use great energy to attack any scientist who does dare ask questions or finds data contrary to the “official” line. Why is it so vitally important that they  continue to promote something that clearly is, to say the least, questionable?

It’s because all of Agenda 21 policy is built on the premise that man is  destroying the Earth. Climate Change is their “proof.” To eliminate that premise is to remove all credibility and purpose for their entire agenda. They are willing to go to any length, even lies, to keep the climate change foot on our throats.

On the local level this translates into planning policy that controls energy use and the efforts to cut down on the use of cars, enforcement of the building of  expensive light rail train systems and bike paths and installation of smart meters, etc.

But don’t take my word for it. I’ll let them speak for themselves:

**“No matter if the science of global warming is all phony…climate change  provides the greatest opportunity to bring about justice and equality in the world.”** ***Christine Stewart (Former Canadian Minister of the Environment)*** 

**“We’ve got to ride this global warming issue. Even if the theory of global  warming is wrong, we will be doing the right thing in terms of economic  and environmental policy.”** ***Timothy Wirth (President, UN Foundation)***

**“It doesn’t matter what is true. It only matters what people believe is true.”** ***Paul Watson (Co-Founder of Green Peace.)***

### II. Fear of over population

Fear is the central driving force behind nearly every Sustainable policy initiative. It’s the real force behind Stack and Pack Smart Growth cities.

The fact is, in developed nations populations are actually going down. The only real growth in the US population in recent years has been from immigration, legal or otherwise. Open border immigration policy is actually implementation of Agenda 21 as part of the drive to destroy national sovereignty and “nation states.”

Environmentalists insist that the borders must be open to allow as many to immigrate here as possible. They argue that the U.S. has a greater ability to control them and protect the environment than if we left them in third world  countries. That’s because the Greens already have a stranglehold over our nation’s industry through massive environmental regulations.

In the face of their fear of overpopulation, however, studies have shown that there is no world wide over population crisis. In fact one study insists that we could put the entire population of the world in an area the size of Texas with a population density of Paris, France. Over population, and its accompanying environmental degradation, is a problem primarily in countries where the poor are deprived by government to improve their conditions. Nations that refuse to legalize private property ownership for the masses, for example, are a primary reason for growing poverty.

Meanwhile, Sustainablists work to keep these nations from developing or increasing energy use, thereby keeping them poor. Green regulations stop the building of infrastructure. They panic at the idea of increased energy use in developing nations. Instead of  working to solve the real problems—the root of poverty- they exploit the excuse of over population and advocate enforcing polices to drastically reduce populations. China’s brutal one child policy of forced abortions and sterilization has become their model.

Do you think I’m joking? Then consider these quotes from the Sustainablists:

**“Childbearing should be a punishable crime against society, unless the parents hold a government license. All potential parents should be required to use contraceptive chemicals, the government issuing antidotes to citizens chosen for childbearing.”** ***David Brower (Sierra Club)***

**“A reasonable estimate for an industrialized world society at the present  North American material standard of living would be 1 billion. At a more  frugal European standard of living, 2 to 3 billion would be possible.”** ***United Nations Global Biodiversity Assessment.***

### III. The destruction of the free market system.

We have heard statement after statement from the UN; from members of  Congress; the news media; and from Hollywood, all deriding the free market system as evil, corrupt and a tool of the rich to hold down the poor. So now, after deciding that the poor are expendable for the sake of stopping overpopulation, suddenly the planners are worried about them—if it leads to their ability to raid our bank accounts. So are they  really worried about protecting the environment—or are they actually honoring the tactics of Jesse James?

Redistribution of wealth is  behind every policy that comes out of the UN, and looking back at the Obama Administration as well. The EPA is the attack dog to shut down entire industries like coal. It has become very difficult to operate a  manufacturing business in the US, and nearly impossible to start a new one. Environmental protection is always the excuse. 

At the UN’s Rio + 20 Summit held in 2012, **the idea of “Zero Economic Growth” was  advocated** \- just to keep things fair. It was stated that even the  building of new roads upsets the status quo and disrupts a well ordered society. Such idiotic ideas are the driving force behind Sustainable Development. Again, images of the Dark Ages come to mind.

Yet,  consider “local” planning programs that cut off access roads, and again,  discourage cars. What about the EPA’s war on industry. Pretty hard to have economic growth without industry. The timber industry is killed and  communities die. Dams are torn down and farmers disappear. Zero Economic Growth in the making. Just local?

Again, not my words, let them tell you themselves:

**“We must make this an insecure and inhospitable place for capitalists and  their projects. We must reclaim the roads and plowed lands, halt dam  construction, tear down existing dams, free shackled rivers and return to wilderness millions of acres of presently settled land.”** ***Dave Foreman, (Earth First).***

**“Global sustainability requires the deliberate quest of poverty, reduced  resource consumption and set levels of mortality control”** ***Professor Maurice King (Population Control Advocate)***

**“We believe planning should be a tool for allocating resources…and  eliminating the great inequalities of wealth and power in our society…  because the free market has proven itself incapable of doing this.”** [*Plannersnetwork.org*](http://plannersnetwork.org/) ***Statement of Principles. the American Planning Association is a member and supporter of these principles.***  

### IV. Cheap Energy is the enemy of the Earth.

To the average person the drive to stop any ability to obtain cheap energy  makes no sense. People are hurting economically. Jobs are lost. Energy costs are skyrocketing. Any attempt to drill oil, fracking of shale gas, and mining coal are all vigorously blocked by government and green policy. Yet the government spends billions of dollars on “alternative  energy” such as wind and solar, which provides less than 3% of our energy needs. Why? What is the motivation to put such shackles on the US economic engine? The excuse is that energy use drives up CO2 emissions and accelerates global warming - the excuse necessary to “harmonize” the  US into the socialist, Sustainable global noose.

Many current state and local policies now are moving to increase taxes at the gas  pump to keep energy costs high. As the prices rise the “planners”  will insist that the only solution is to enforce the building of expensive public transportation.

But, according to some anti-energy advocates, the fear of cheap energy goes beyond environmental protection - energy availability helps build wealth for  individuals and removes them from the rolls of the dependent—the  opposite goal of sustainable policy.

**“Giving society cheap, abundant energy is the worst thing that could ever happen to the planet.”** ***Prof. Paul Ehrlich (Professor of Population Studies, Stanford University).***

**“Complex technology of any sort is an assault on human dignity. It would be  little short of disastrous for us to discover a source of clean, cheap,  abundant energy, because of what we might do with it.”** ***Amory Lovins (Rocky Mountain Institute).***  

**“The prospect of cheap fusion energy is the worst thing that could happen to the planet.”** ***Jeremy Rifkin (Greenhouse Crisis Foundation).***

Alternative theory to explain global warming. No debunk so far,"Humans consume 10 million gigatons of water each year. 70% of that is used to water  plants in agriculture (1). The water on the fields has 3 ways to go:
 - sinking deep into lower levels of the soil 
 - evaporate 
 - being absorbed by the plants (what also eventually leads to evaporation, because plants evaporate water over the leaves)

Actually farmers try to increase field water efficiency (fraction of water used by plants to total water used) but let’s say only 10% evaporate. That means 700 000 gigatons of water evaporate each year. Most of it by Irrigation. Rivers are redirected and spread over huge agricultural areas. On that area the sun developes enough energy to evaporate the water while it would just run into  the ocean without human influence. So we are basically evaporating rivers all over the world. And that is much more efficient than digging for coal and burn it.

But what about rain? Water doesn’t stay in the atmosphere!

Yes, and that’s why many reliable sources claim human couldn’t influence water content in the atmosphere. Because it comes down again, it can’t increase, can it? Yes of course it can. The numbers of airplanes in the air is increasing even though they don’t stuck in the air. Around 16000 planes are in the air right now (2019) and this number is going to increase. Around 200000 takeoffs  every day, which means around 8000 take offs per hour. An average flight duration of 2 hours means, that when you take off, 16 000 other planes take off before you land. And if you increase the take offs per hour you will have more planes in the air, even if the average duration remains at 2 hours.
So the same thing with water. Water remains about 10 days in the atmosphere (2). As mentioned earlier, 700 000 gigatons are evaporated each year. That means 2000 gigatons per day. So within the 10 day lifetime of water 20 000 gigatons are  evaporated due to human influences. Compared to CO2 we emit 30 gigatons each year. according to the simple calculation above we increased the water content much more than we increased CO2. And that while H2O is a much more potent greenhouse gas than CO2. That would mean water vapor is the main cause of global warming!

Why can’t we measure the increase of water?

A gas needs around 1 year to reach each part of the atmosphere and even longer to be homogeneously mixed in the atmosphere. Since the lifetime of CO2 is so large, it actually is almost homogeneously mixed in the atmosphere. That means if you measure CO2 in only one spot, you know the content on alle other spots, because it’s the same.
H20 however has a short life time. The water content varies extremely in different location. When you see clouds, the water content is higher in the cloud than right next to it. You would need an infinite amount of measure spots to estimate the global water content in the atmosphere. Secondly the water content is around 2%. 2.43% or 2.44% is an increase by less than 1%. But for CO2 a difference between 0,03 and 0,04 is significant enough to be measured.

But we can’t add water to the atmosphere!

I never understood this argument. Ever hang out wet laundry? It dries in the sun. The water doesn’t disappear, it evaporates and is in the atmosphere. If the relative humidity (RH) was 100% the clothes wouldn’t dry. Sweating would be inefficient and you would have fog. At 100% RH you need to heat the air in order to take up more water. However when RH is below 100% it can take up more water. That’s the definition of RH. And as we observe in daily life, 100% RH is not common on surface altitude. That’s how sweating works, water is evaporating from the skin to cool the skin. And that’s possible without heating up the air, otherwise evolution wouldn’t have given us the ability to sweat.

Possible mistakes/errors

* most trivial would be a failed conversion between gigatons, cubic meter, kg etc.. because we are talking about millions of gigatons it’s possible. I think I did it right but maybe double check.
* error in the basic concept: maybe I overlooked something. Most likely the point why humans can’t add water to atmosphere. Many sources claim we have to heat up the air to increase water content. But I don’t understand why. I think it would be true at 100%RH but below we can ofcourse evaporate water as we observe in daily life. In Chile millions of liter of water are pumped to the surface and evaporated by the sun because in the remaining salt Lithium can be found. I think I gave enough example why I think we actually can evaporate water. The claim we can’t sounds so stupid to me, I don’t know why everyone says that.
* some more complex phenomenon is involved. Maybe water evaporated from agriculture has a different life time. A few hours would be enough though. The amount of water evaporation is so much higher than the CO2... Also i don’t see why water vapor from humans would behave different than natural vapor. We are basically just wetting the earths surface. Then the sun does the rest in natural processes.

"""Climate Change"" is Bullshit. Why Politicized Science is Dangerous","# ""Those who can make you believe absurdities can make you commit atrocities""

# ---Voltaire

&amp;#x200B;

**Imagine that there is a new scientific theory that warns of an impending crisis, and points to a way out.**

This theory quickly draws support from leading scientists, politicians and celebrities around the world. Research is funded by distinguished philanthropies, and carried out at prestigious universities. The crisis is reported frequently in the media. The science is taught in college and high school classrooms.

I don’t mean global warming. I’m talking about another theory, which rose to prominence a century ago.

Its supporters included Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, and Winston Churchill. It was approved by Supreme Court justices Oliver Wendell Holmes and Louis Brandeis, who ruled in its favor. The famous names who supported it included Alexander Graham Bell, inventor of the telephone; activist Margaret Sanger; botanist Luther Burbank; Leland Stanford, founder of Stanford University; the novelist H. G. Wells; the playwright George Bernard Shaw; and hundreds of others. Nobel Prize winners gave support. Research was backed by the Carnegie and Rockefeller Foundations. The Cold Springs Harbor Institute was built to carry out this research, but important work was also done at Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Stanford and Johns Hopkins. Legislation to address the crisis was passed in states from New York to California.

These efforts had the support of the National Academy of Sciences, the American Medical Association, and the National Research Council. It was said that if Jesus were alive, he would have supported this effort.

All in all, the research, legislation and molding of public opinion surrounding the theory went on for almost half a century. Those who opposed the theory were shouted down and called reactionary, blind to reality, or just plain ignorant. But in hindsight, what is surprising is that so few people objected.

Today, we know that this famous theory that gained so much support was actually pseudoscience. The crisis it claimed was nonexistent. And the actions taken in the name of theory were morally and criminally wrong. Ultimately, they led to the deaths of millions of people.

**The theory was eugenics, and its history is so dreadful — and, to those who were caught up in it, so embarrassing — that it is now rarely discussed. But it is a story that should be well know to every citizen, so that its horrors are not repeated.**

The theory of eugenics postulated a crisis of the gene pool leading to the deterioration of the human race. The best human beings were not breeding as rapidly as the inferior ones — the foreigners, immigrants, Jews, degenerates, the unfit, and the “feeble minded.” Francis Galton, a respected British scientist, first speculated about this area, but his ideas were taken far beyond anything he intended. They were adopted by science-minded Americans, as well as those who had no interest in science but who were worried about the immigration of inferior races early in the twentieth century — “dangerous human pests” who represented “the rising tide of imbeciles” and who were polluting the best of the human race.

The eugenicists and the immigrationists joined forces to put a stop to this. The plan was to identify individuals who were feeble-minded — Jews were agreed to be largely feeble-minded, but so were many foreigners, as well as blacks — and stop them from breeding by isolation in institutions or by sterilization.

As Margaret Sanger said, “Fostering the good-for-nothing at the expense of the good is an extreme cruelty … there is not greater curse to posterity than that of bequeathing them an increasing population of imbeciles.” She spoke of the burden of caring for “this dead weight of human waste.”

Such views were widely shared. H.G. Wells spoke against “ill-trained swarms of inferior citizens.” Theodore Roosevelt said that “Society has no business to permit degenerates to reproduce their kind.” Luther Burbank” “Stop permitting criminals and weaklings to reproduce.” George Bernard Shaw said that only eugenics could save mankind.

There was overt racism in this movement, exemplified by texts such as “The Rising Tide of Color Against White World Supremacy” by American author Lothrop Stoddard. But, at the time, racism was considered an unremarkable aspect of the effort to attain a marvelous goal — the improvement of humankind in the future. It was this avant-garde notion that attracted the most liberal and progressive minds of a generation. California was one of twenty-nine American states to pass laws allowing sterilization, but it proved the most-forward-looking and enthusiastic — more sterilizations were carried out in California than anywhere else in America.

Eugenics research was funded by the Carnegie Foundation, and later by the Rockefeller Foundation. The latter was so enthusiastic that even after the center of the eugenics effort moved to Germany, and involved the gassing of individuals from mental institutions, the Rockefeller Foundation continued to finance German researchers at a very high level. (The foundation was quiet about it, but they were still funding research in 1939, only months before the onset of World War II.)

Since the 1920s, American eugenicists had been jealous because the Germans had taken leadership of the movement away from them. The Germans were admirably progressive. They set up ordinary-looking houses where “mental defectives” were brought and interviewed one at a time, before being led into a back room, which was, in fact, a gas chamber. There, they were gassed with carbon monoxide, and their bodies disposed of in a crematorium located on the property.

Eventually, this program was expanded into a vast network of concentration camps located near railroad lines, enabling the efficient transport and of killing of 'undesirables'.

After World War II, nobody was a eugenicist, and nobody had ever been a eugenicist. Biographers of the celebrated and the powerful did not dwell on the attractions of this philosophy to their subjects, and sometimes did not mention it at all. Eugenics ceased to be a subject for college classrooms, although some argue that its ideas continue to have currency in disguised form.

But in retrospect, three points stand out. First, despite the construction of Cold Springs Harbor Laboratory, despite the efforts of universities and the pleadings of lawyers, there was no scientific basis for eugenics. In fact, nobody at that time knew what a gene really was. The movement was able to proceed because it employed vague terms never rigorously defined. “Feeble-mindedness” could mean anything from poverty to illiteracy to epilepsy. Similarly, there was no clear definition of “degenerate” or “unfit.”

Second, the eugenics movement was really a social program masquerading as a scientific one. What drove it was concern about immigration and racism and undesirable people moving into one’s neighborhood or country. Once again, vague terminology helped conceal what was really going on.

Third, and most distressing, the scientific establishment in both the United States and Germany did not mount any sustained protest. Quite the contrary. In Germany scientists quickly fell into line with the program. Modern German researchers have gone back to review Nazi documents from the 1930s. They expected to find directives telling scientists what research should be done. But none were necessary. In the words of Ute Deichman, “Scientists, including those who were not members of the \[Nazi\] party, helped to get funding for their work through their modified behavior and direct cooperation with the state.” Deichman speaks of the “active role of scientists themselves in regard to Nazi race policy … where \[research\] was aimed at confirming the racial doctrine … no external pressure can be documented.” German scientists adjusted their research interests to the new policies. And those few who did not adjust disappeared.

A second example of politicized science is quite different in character, but it exemplifies the hazard of government ideology controlling the work of science, and of uncritical media promoting false concepts. Trofim Denisovich Lysenko was a self-promoting peasant who, it was said, “solved the problem of fertilizing the fields without fertilizers and minerals.” In 1928 he claimed to have invented a procedure called vernalization, by which seeds were moistened and chilled to enhance the later growth of crops.

Lysenko’s methods never faced a rigorous test, but his claim that his treated seeds passed on their characteristics to the next generation represented a revival of Lamarckian ideas at a time when the rest of the world was embracing Mendelian genetics. Josef Stalin was drawn to Lamarckian ideas, which implied a future unbounded by hereditary constraints; he also wanted improved agricultural production. Lysenko promised both, and became the darling of a Soviet media that was on the lookout for stories about clever peasants who had developed revolutionary procedures.

Lysenko was portrayed as a genius, and he milked his celebrity for all it was worth. He was especially skillful at denouncing this opponents. He used questionnaires from farmers to prove that vernalization increased crop yields, and thus avoided any direct tests. Carried on a wave of state-sponsored enthusiasm, his rise was rapid. By 1937, he was a member of the Supreme Soviet.

By then, Lysenko and his theories dominated Russian biology. The result was famines that killed millions, and purges that sent hundreds of dissenting Soviet scientists to the gulags or the firing squads. Lysenko was aggressive in attacking genetics, which was finally banned as “bourgeois pseudoscience” in 1948. There was never any basis for Lysenko’s ideas, yet he controlled Soviet research for thirty years. Lysenkoism ended in the 1960s, but Russian biology still has not entirely recovered from that era.

Now we are engaged in a great new theory that once again has drawn the support of politicians, scientists, and celebrities around the world.

* Once again, the theory is promoted by major foundations.
* Once again, the research is carried out at prestigious universities.
* Once again, legislation is passed and social programs are urged in its name.
* Once again, critics are few and harshly dealt with.
* Once again, the measures being urged have little basis in fact or science.
* Once again, groups with other agendas are hiding behind a movement that appears high-minded.
* Once again, claims of moral superiority are used to justify extreme actions.
* Once again, the fact that some people are hurt is shrugged off because an abstract cause is said to be greater than any human consequences.
* Once again, vague terms like sustainability and generational justice — terms that have no agreed definition — are employed in the service of a new crisis.

I am not arguing that global warming is the same as eugenics. But the similarities are not superficial. And I do claim that open and frank discussion of the data, and of the issues, is being suppressed. Leading scientific journals have taken strong editorial positions of the side of global warming, which, I argue, they have no business doing. Under the circumstances, any scientist who has doubts understands clearly that they will be wise to mute their expression.

One proof of this suppression is the fact that so many of the outspoken critics of global warming are retired professors. These individuals are not longer seeking grants, and no longer have to face colleagues whose grant applications and career advancement may be jeopardized by their criticisms.

In science, the old men are usually wrong. But in politics, the old men are wise, counsel caution, and in the end are often right.

The past history of human belief is a cautionary tale. We have killed thousands of our fellow human beings because we believed they had signed a contract with the devil, and had become witches. We still kill more than a thousand people each year for witchcraft. In my view, there is only one hope for humankind to emerge from what Carl Sagan called “the demon-haunted world” of our past. That hope is science.

But as Alston Chase put it, “when the search for truth is confused with political advocacy, the pursuit of knowledge is reduced to the quest for power.”

That is the danger we now face. And this is why the intermixing of science and politics is a bad combination, with a bad history. We must remember the history, and be certain that what we present to the world as knowledge is disinterested and honest.

And I haven't been able to find any unbiased, clear information either-- for some reason, volcanoes are treated as totally different and only studied in isolation, even though the gases produced by those and human activity are all the same.

"I'm a climate alarmist wishing to step outside the echo chamber, please show me arguments and studies I can read.","Hello everyone

I've been doing activism lately, among other things against climate change. It has occurred to me that while I am somewhat familiar with the arguments, studies and data that suggest human made climate change is real, I do not know much about arguments and data that suggest the opposite.

I want to see both sides here so I can draw my own conclusions having seen all the arguments, I don't want to form my opinion on the topic with only information from my echo chamber. Please send me arguments against climate change, as well as scientific studies. I have lots of free time in the next 24 hours, so I can hopefully read through several studies.

Here's my current opinion on the topic so we'll have a starting point for the debate:

""Greenhouse gases like CO2, methane and others are causing the greenhouse gas effect which increases the average temperature on Earth's surface. This has allowed life on Earth to develop in the first place. Due to heavy use of fossil fuels, animal agriculture and others, humanity is rapidly increasing the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, pushing the warming effect beyond the natural balance. This is, and will be causing, according to scientific predictions, biodiversity loss, an increase of global mean temperature, an increase of extreme weather events, loss of arable land to desertification loss of living space due to flooding, and several hundreds of millions of refugees.""

I look forward to an enlightening conversation and to reading some studies. Thanks in advance for sending me arguments and sources.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit 1: Thanks a lot for all the sources and articles sent already, it will take me some time to read through them, I might not be able to respond to each of you personally, especially if the rate of informative answers with sources continues at this rate. The IPCC AR5 and SR15 reports will keep me busy for quite some time, I imagine.

I am from r/collapse. It is rank with confirmation bias. I came here for some good counter arguments and hopefully good news.,"I am from r/collapse. I joined some 2 months back when i found it while browsing some other news article regarding doomsday.

We have absolutely no hopeful news there at all. This can't be. There are people doing a lot of stuff and there has to be some good news. This smelled like confirmation bias. So I came here looking for counter arguments.

Here is what i know:

1. Permafrost has a lot of methane frozen away. (Is this true? How did it get frozen there in the first place?)

2. Methane is a very potent green house gas. Depending upon how you count it is 70-83 times more potent than CO2.

3. We have taken carbon out of the ground and released it into the atmosphere in last 150 years. We increased the co2 levels to 412ppm from~250ppm. This has already increased the average temp by 0.8C from pre industrial levels.


4. Increasing temperature melts white ice that reflects suns light. This creating a feedback loop that further increases the temp.

5. One day we will melt permafrost and release methane. This will dramatically increase temperature. This will melt more permafrost and release more methane and thus create another feedback loop.

6. All this temp increase will be as bad as permian extinction when some volcano caused this permafrost (or was it clathrate) to release methane and kill 90% of all life. This is extremely bad scenario when permafrost releases 5% of its methane in to the air when one fine day melting sets off one of the clathrate guns.

Meanwhile increasing temps would cause extreme weathers, disrupt food security, increase spread of diseases which were checked by cool climate etc. etc. humans are bad neighbors under stressful conditions and we have a collapse.",climateskeptics

Ticks will migrate into and infest areas where you used to enjoy hiking, due to them coming out earlier each year.

Trees killed in an unprecedented flood in Italy. Mass cattle die-off in Australia's post-drought floods.

Look up the ski resort in Chacaltaya, Bolivia and see how it's doing.

Each year, human beings release an increasing amount of carbon dioxide (C02) into the atmosphere; at present, around 40 billion tons per annum.

In 2018, there were 14 weather and climate disaster events with losses exceeding $1 billion each across the United States.

A small rodent named  the Bramble Cay melomys that lived only on a single island off Australia is likely the world's first mammal to become a casualty of climate change. Since 1998, the part of the island that sits above high tide has shrunk from 9.8 acres to 6.2 acres. That means the island's vegetation has been shrinking, and the rodents have lost about 97 percent of their habitat.

Or how about all of these actual facts presented here:  [https://www.un.org/en/sections/issues-depth/climate-change/](https://www.un.org/en/sections/issues-depth/climate-change/)

Soooooo what's next, are you gonna start saying the Earth is flat? Or that the government faked the moon landing?

This is how the NOAA is not only lying about temps by adding 1 deg. C. to those ground records, but by adding nonexistent SN's to the data, in order to ignore, downplay the Current solar sunspot minimum.

Have to subtract about 10-30 SN's to get the actual, historically comparative data.

"from 2018, remember the ocean floor methane hydrate hype?","The money quote for this forum from [a 2018 study](https://phys.org/news/2018-01-ocean-ancient-methane.html) is

&gt;Our data suggest that even if increasing amounts of methane are released from degrading hydrates as climate change proceeds, catastrophic emission to the atmosphere is not an inherent outcome""


background: 10-5 years ago alarmists used to go on and on about accelerations involving methane release. *Warming will cause even more warming!*  was screamed to the tune of 'we are all going to die!' by the climate industrial complex barbershop quartet. An RCP on steroids.

Not only did this hypothesis take a hit when (after around 2010) atmospheric methane levels stopped following  emissions but, more fundamentally, about bacteria which eats the gas. 

The methane came from two places, in theory: melting taiga and ocean bottom clathrates (aka hydrates)

- taiga: a few years ago, it was measured there is less  CH4 over when it melts than there is when it is  frozen (because the bacteria comes to life). Less, not more.

- ocean floor, last year, the OP link: using D/H ratio, methane released from ocean floors does not make it to the surface

So much for that acceleration, super-quickly forgotten by the climate hamsters.

The First Global Revolution (1991),"My cause for skepticism lies in the motives of those who refer to climate change to demand more power and money from the people. If you trace back the history of UN groups and activities on climate change, you'll quickly arrive at the think tank ""Club of Rome"" which was founded among others by David Rockefeller (oil and banking billionaire).

This think tank published an initial critique on economic growth (""The Limits to Growth"") in 1972, followed by - more interestingly - a blueprint to how the world should be run in the 21st century: ""The First Global Revolution"". This latter book was published in 1991, closely preceding the UN conference in Rio in 1992 that kicked off environmental efforts (from the UN perspective that's Agenda 21 followed by Agenda 2030).

They literally said in the book, and this does appear to be a legitimate quote:

&gt;Because of the sudden absence of traditional enemies, ""new enemies must be identified.""[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_First_Global_Revolution#cite_note-King70-2)  ""**In searching for a new enemy to unite us, we came up with the idea  that pollution, the threat of global warming, water shortages, famine  and the like would fit the bill**....All these dangers are caused by human  intervention, and it is only through changed attitudes and behavior  that they can be overcome. The real enemy then, is humanity itself.""[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_First_Global_Revolution#cite_note-King115-3)

So this would be quite consistent with the idea that environmental problems are being hijacked in an effort to gain power and money for unelected elites, in essence taking us back to NWO conspiracies. Looking into the background of many UN representatives, they are in many cases also from big oil and finance, and some have been involved in bad corruption scandals, so it's not an immediately credible claim to make that they are in it purely for the good of all mankind.

There's also this ongoing conflict between UN / Western goals of reducing CO2 emissions and supporting mass immigration and overpopulation, most of which typically trace back to rich and powerful supporters as well ( [http://www.centuryinitiative.ca/about/](http://www.centuryinitiative.ca/about/) , [https://www.weforum.org/reports/business-case-migration](https://www.weforum.org/reports/business-case-migration) , [https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-18519395](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-18519395) ).

There's the argument that nobody cares for the UN anyway and they have no say in anything, but Western governments and supranational organizations largely seem to agree immediately on most of these things. I'm not  sure how these dominant globalist organizations relate to socialist / green parties though.

Recommend regular reading of The Drudgereport, Breitbart, and The Watchers to keep apprized of some of the more interesting, useful and detailed news, which is unlikely to be seen on the ""Nightly Snoozes"".

For the more extreme afficianados, be careful with Infowars. It's loaded with a lot of anti-vaxxers and other info processing problems.

But recall, the greatest growth. new events occurring, does not any longer come from the standard news networks and what they report. Rather, given the massive decline of the sciences from junk science reports, which esp is damaging medical pharmacologies, just do a lot of careful checking to ascertain what's ""Likely"" going on.

As far as today's news in the Middle East and the climate of events there, Jpost.com of Jerusalem for weather and other such; and the very interesting Dailystar.com.lb from Beirut, which gives a more expansive and interesting viewpoint about Middle East events and climate events, as well.

Lots of times the Jpost and the Daily Star are the ONLY sources giving details about what's going on with the weather there, confirming the problems, as well. Such as the loss of about 50% of Iran's Agro land and spring plantings, which will have a devastatin effect upon their food production. Starvation widely is possible.

And 40% of bridges and transport infrastructure damaged by storms, well past easy repairs, within the last few weeks.

So read widely, and as a former older, yet highly experienced woman once told me so presciently &amp; wisely:

Read widely and compare, compare, compare to find out what's likely going on.

Better wisdom than that have yet to find regarding climate events and related weather news, outside of the Watchers.",climateskeptics

The skeptic position,"My sense is that most skeptics agree that the Earth has been warming since the 1800s. The questions are

- how much of that global warming is anthropogenic (this can diverge from the consensus that the majority is human caused)

- how much of the anthropogenic warming is related to co2 emissions (deforestation, albedo change, urban heat can have their own share)

- how much global temperature affects local climate and weather (we can potentially make all the changes to remove any human effect on global temperature, and still have huge changes in climate)

- what extent are the negative effects of local climate and weather changes (alarmism says we're all going to become climate refugees and then die. Maybe we just crank up the ac and grow coffee in Canada)

- what positive effects we might see (higher co2 could lead to food abundance)

- what the cost to transition to a zero carbon economy is (many act like this has no cost to quality of life, but indications are that limiting carbon economies would lead to suffering)

I'd even go further to say that to be a ""climate change denier"", one would need to deny that any changes in local climates are occurring over decades.
