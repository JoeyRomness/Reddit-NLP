"Debunking ""climate skeptics,"" part 1. There is no greenhouse gas effect.","Hi guys! I'm thinking about making a series of posts debunking various ""climate skeptic"" arguments. First, I'll say that ""climate skeptic"" is a poorly defined term, but that seems to be the self-identification a lot of these people use. These ""climate skeptics"" run the gamut from fairly reasonable people like Judith Curry to nutjobs like Anthony Heller. Maybe I'll get to him later.

So today's post is about people who don't even think there is a greenhouse effect. I've argued with several people like this in a different climate subreddit. There's even a paper by Nikolov and Zeller (2017) about it (see sources below).

There's a fun little story about these guys. So there was a paper published by Volokin and ReLlez (2014), well, it turns out that's just Nikolov and Zeller spelling their names backwards. So I guess now it's Nikolov and Zeller (2014). Anthony Watts wrote about this. In case you're not aware, Anthony Watts runs [wattsupwiththat.com](https://wattsupwiththat.com), a ""climate skeptic"" blog, so you might expect they would have a sympathetic view towards the paper. Here's what Watts had to say about it ([https://wattsupwiththat.com/2016/09/14/climate-skeptics-behaving-badly/](https://wattsupwiththat.com/2016/09/14/climate-skeptics-behaving-badly/)):

""Submitting a paper with your names reversed? I’m sorry… **This. is. just. stupid.** And I agree with Gavin, the paper itself is nonsense. Their work has been the same sort of “pressure rules the temperature of planetary atmospheres” nonsense that the irascible Doug Cotton pushes…under multiple fake names to try to get attention, here and elsewhere. Now they seem to have followed his lead.

I’ve had experience with these two people, Nikolov and Zeller before….and it has not been a good experience. There’s some behind the scenes ugliness they presented in email that I don’t plan to talk about. That’s why I don’t carry their views anymore and never will again, that’s doubly true now after this sad move with the fake names.""

Anyway, enough of the silly drama, let's look at what the papers say. So the standard view of the greenhouse effect is (Schmidt 2010):

""The global mean greenhouse effect can be defined as the difference between the planetary blackbody emitting temperature (in balance with the absorbed solar irradiance) and the global mean surface temperature. The actual mean surface temperature is larger (by around 33°C, assuming a constant planetary albedo) due to the absorption and emission of long‐wave (LW) radiation in the atmosphere by a number of different “greenhouse” substances.""

In other words, without an atmosphere, earth's temperature would be \~33 degrees Celsius cooler. So Nikolov and Zeller (2014) calculate the difference, using unconventional methods, as \~90 degrees Celsius:

""Physical evidence is presented that Earth’s ATE should be assessed against the temperature of an equivalent airless body such as the Moon rather than a hypothetical atmosphere devoid of greenhouse gases. Employing the new temperature formula we show that Earth’s *total* ATE is \~90 K, not 33 K, and that ATE = GE + TE, where GE is the thermal effect of greenhouse gases, while TE &gt; 15 K is a thermodynamic enhancement independent of the atmospheric infrared back radiation. It is concluded that the contribution of greenhouse gases to Earth’s ATE defined as GE = ATE – TE might be greater than 33 K, but will remain uncertain until the strength of the hereto identified TE is fully quantified by future research.""

So, unusual, but if true this would seem to indicate that traditional estimates of the total greenhouse effect are actually underestimates, with some (at that point) nebulous additional contribution raising the global temperature.

Nikolov and Zeller (2017) runs this even farther off the rails:

""A key entailment from the model is that the atmospheric ‘greenhouse effect’ currently viewed as a radiative phenomenon is in fact an adiabatic (pressure-induced) thermal enhancement analogous to compression heating and independent of atmospheric composition.""

According to them, planetary temperatures are only dependent on top-of-the-atmosphere solar irradiance and total surface atmospheric pressure. How'd they come to that conclusion? It's an interesting case, the paper may look convincing on the surface. Roughly, they came up with a bunch of regression models using physical parameters for various solar system bodies, found one that seemed to show that the surface temperature could be calculated using solar irradiance and atmospheric pressure, then concluded that only those two variables contribute to planetary temperature.

This blog post ([http://rabett.blogspot.com/2017/08/making-elephant-dance-as-performed-by.html](http://rabett.blogspot.com/2017/08/making-elephant-dance-as-performed-by.html)) breaks it down some more:

""So briefly, what goes on is to fit the five average surface temperatures of five plants or moons (Venus, Earth, the Moon, Mars, Titan and Triton.  Wait you say, that's six, not five, but they leave Titan out of the mix because  (Eli told you this would be yummy) to an arbitrary functional form

y = *a* exp(*b*x) + *c* exp(*d*x)

Wait you say again, ok, that is four parameters and the functional form plucked out of thin air, but what is *x* and *y.*  That's kind of interesting and more than a bit light fingered but you have to watch the moving cup.  The independent variable is a ratio of pressures *(Ps/Pr)*.  *Ps* is the pressure at the surface, *Pr*, well that's interesting, *Pr* starts out as the ""*minimum air pressure required for the existence of a liquid solvent at the surface, hereto called a reference pressure (Pr)*"" but about a page further on it morphs into

&gt;For a reference pressure, we used the gas-liquid-solid triple point of water, i.e., *Pr*=611.73Pa \[38\] defining a baric threshold, below which water can only exists in a solid/vapor phase and not in a liquid form. The results of our analysis are not sensitive to the particular choice of a reference pressure value; hence, the selection of *Pr* is a matter of convention.

The alert out there have noticed that the minimum air pressure required for the existence of a liquid solvent at the surface kind of depends on the temperature of the surface, and would vary widely from planet to planet. Of course worry bunnies like Eli might ask:  What liquid?  Water exists as water on the surface of the Earth, if there was any as steam at Venus and as ice at all the others if it exists there at all.  For Venus maybe CO2, but at the surface of Venus CO2 is a supercritical fluid and you can't tell the difference between liquid and gas.  At Titan, there are oceans, but oceans of methane, so any useful *Pr* is going to be wildly different for all of these bodies and, in the case of the Mars, and Triton some pretty fancy liquids are going to be needed.

Selection of water as the solvent of choice is then both arbitrary and unphysical.  But why do Nikolov and Zeller insist on using it? Turns out their elephantine trunk waving depends on using dimensionless variables, but restricting *Pr* to an inappropriate value independent of the planet is equivalent to stripping the units off of the surface pressure *Ps*.""

&amp;#x200B;

So, the paper is a good example of how, with enough statistics and cherry-picking, and enough variables, you can come to almost any conclusion you want. It is to be expected that you would find a correlation between atmospheric pressure and planetary temperature; planets with a denser atmosphere generally have more greenhouse gases. Of course, the paper fails to explain the TOA absorption spectrum or other evidence for the greenhouse effect ([http://geosci.uchicago.edu/\~rtp1/papers/PhysTodayRT2011.pdf](http://geosci.uchicago.edu/~rtp1/papers/PhysTodayRT2011.pdf)). Am I being too dismissive? Well, in the more rational parts of ""climate skeptic"" world, the paper was also dismissed. I usually take anything published at wattsupwiththat with a big grain of salt, but here ([https://wattsupwiththat.com/2012/01/13/a-matter-of-some-gravity/?fbclid=IwAR1Lkiqzw8bCx06u5ABMQMfevy0bweKzZfdBatFOIj0aWTAmi\_HrcKEYJDQ](https://wattsupwiththat.com/2012/01/13/a-matter-of-some-gravity/?fbclid=IwAR1Lkiqzw8bCx06u5ABMQMfevy0bweKzZfdBatFOIj0aWTAmi_HrcKEYJDQ)) Eschenbach does a decent job explaining why the hypothesis of Nikolov and Zeller violates the law of conservation of energy:

""I hold that with a transparent GHG-free atmosphere, neither the hypothetical “N&amp;Z effect” nor the “Jelbring effect” can possibly raise the planetary temperature above the theoretical S-B temperature. But I also make a much more general claim. I hold it can be proven that there is **no possible mechanism involving gravity and the atmosphere** that can raise the temperature of a planet with a transparent GHG-free atmosphere above the theoretical S-B temperature.

The proof is by contradiction. This is a proof where you assume that the theorem is right, and then show that if it is right it leads to an impossible situation, so it cannot possibly be right.

So let us assume that we have the airless perfectly evenly heated blackbody planet that I spoke of above, evenly surrounded by a sphere of mini-suns. The temperature of this theoretical planet is, of course, the theoretical S-B temperature.

Now suppose we add an atmosphere to the planet, a transparent GHG-free atmosphere. If the theories of N&amp;K and Jelbring are correct, the temperature of the planet will rise.

But when the temperature of a perfect blackbody planet rises … the surface radiation of that planet must rise as well.

And because the atmosphere is transparent, this means that **the planet is radiating to space more energy than it receives.** This is an obvious violation of conservation of energy, so any theories proposing such a warming must be incorrect.

Q.E.D.""

And some more criticism of Nikolov and Zeller from blogs (no one has bothered to publish a rebuttal in the literature):

That got me thinking, how many trees does a person have to plant in order to reach that goal (considering every person on Earth does it). So one trillion trees divided by 7.53 billion people equals **1,328,021.25.**

Is it do-able? Can one person plant over a million trees, or is there any other way to organize in order to reach the trillion trees goal?

Climate change university challenge — product advice,"Hey guys, the University has issued a challenge where we must creat any product that is somehow related to climate change. It does not need to be complicated — it can be a basic product that perhaps inspires tools for the future. It also DOES NOT need to solve climate change — it can look at something Super specific (like rising insect population due to higher temperatures that is killing more crops in Africa). Basically, if the product attempts to solve anything vaguely related to climate change, it is acceptable. 

Any ideas or starting points y’all have will be greatly appreciated. It can be a tech product, policy, mathematical framework of some idea, economic solution etc etc etc

Couldn’t find a flaw in this conspiracy about an alternative cause of global warming,"Humans consume 10 million gigatons of water each year. 70% of that is used to water  plants in agriculture (1). The water on the fields has 3 ways to go:
 - sinking deep into lower levels of the soil 
 - evaporate 
 - being absorbed by the plants (what also eventually leads to evaporation, because plants evaporate water over the leaves)

Actually farmers try to increase field water efficiency (fraction of water used by plants to total water used) but let’s say only 10% evaporate. That means 700 000 gigatons of water evaporate each year. Most of it by Irrigation. Rivers are redirected and spread over huge agricultural areas. On that area the sun developes enough energy to evaporate the water while it would just run into  the ocean without human influence. So we are basically evaporating rivers all over the world. And that is much more efficient than digging for coal and burn it.

But what about rain? Water doesn’t stay in the atmosphere!

Yes, and that’s why many reliable sources claim human couldn’t influence water content in the atmosphere. Because it comes down again, it can’t increase, can it? Yes of course it can. The numbers of airplanes in the air is increasing even though they don’t stuck in the air. Around 16000 planes are in the air right now (2019) and this number is going to increase. Around 200000 takeoffs  every day, which means around 8000 take offs per hour. An average flight duration of 2 hours means, that when you take off, 16 000 other planes take off before you land. And if you increase the take offs per hour you will have more planes in the air, even if the average duration remains at 2 hours.
So the same thing with water. Water remains about 10 days in the atmosphere (2). As mentioned earlier, 700 000 gigatons are evaporated each year. That means 2000 gigatons per day. So within the 10 day lifetime of water 20 000 gigatons are  evaporated due to human influences. Compared to CO2 we emit 30 gigatons each year. according to the simple calculation above we increased the water content much more than we increased CO2. And that while H2O is a much more potent greenhouse gas than CO2. That would mean water vapor is the main cause of global warming!

Why can’t we measure the increase of water?

A gas needs around 1 year to reach each part of the atmosphere and even longer to be homogeneously mixed in the atmosphere. Since the lifetime of CO2 is so large, it actually is almost homogeneously mixed in the atmosphere. That means if you measure CO2 in only one spot, you know the content on alle other spots, because it’s the same.
H20 however has a short life time. The water content varies extremely in different location. When you see clouds, the water content is higher in the cloud than right next to it. You would need an infinite amount of measure spots to estimate the global water content in the atmosphere. Secondly the water content is around 2%. 2.43% or 2.44% is an increase by less than 1%. But for CO2 a difference between 0,03 and 0,04 is significant enough to be measured.

But we can’t add water to the atmosphere!

I never understood this argument. Ever hang out wet laundry? It dries in the sun. The water doesn’t disappear, it evaporates and is in the atmosphere. If the relative humidity (RH) was 100% the clothes wouldn’t dry. Sweating would be inefficient and you would have fog. At 100% RH you need to heat the air in order to take up more water. However when RH is below 100% it can take up more water. That’s the definition of RH. And as we observe in daily life, 100% RH is not common on surface altitude. That’s how sweating works, water is evaporating from the skin to cool the skin. And that’s possible without heating up the air, otherwise evolution wouldn’t have given us the ability to sweat.

Possible mistakes/errors

* most trivial would be a failed conversion between gigatons, cubic meter, kg etc.. because we are talking about millions of gigatons it’s possible. I think I did it right but maybe double check.
* error in the basic concept: maybe I overlooked something. Most likely the point why humans can’t add water to atmosphere. Many sources claim we have to heat up the air to increase water content. But I don’t understand why. I think it would be true at 100%RH but below we can ofcourse evaporate water as we observe in daily life. In Chile millions of liter of water are pumped to the surface and evaporated by the sun because in the remaining salt Lithium can be found. I think I gave enough example why I think we actually can evaporate water. The claim we can’t sounds so stupid to me, I don’t know why everyone says that.
* some more complex phenomenon is involved. Maybe water evaporated from agriculture has a different life time. A few hours would be enough though. The amount of water evaporation is so much higher than the CO2... Also i don’t see why water vapor from humans would behave different than natural vapor. We are basically just wetting the earths surface. Then the sun does the rest in natural processes.

I think it’s more likely I did a mistake and that most of other scientists are right. However I didn’t find a flaw here. Most people I explained this to blamed me as a sceptic but didn’t have any scientific argument. I’m open to discussion but I hope you are open too and can consider my thoughts scientifically and neutrally even though it’s against the consensus.
Thank you.

* error in the basic concept: maybe I overlooked something. Most likely the point why humans can’t add water to atmosphere. Many sources claim we have to heat up the air to increase water content. But I don’t understand why. I think it would be true at 100%RH but below we can ofcourse evaporate water as we observe in daily life. In Chile millions of liter of water are pumped to the surface and evaporated by the sun because in the remaining salt Lithium can be found. I think I gave enough example why I think we actually can evaporate water. The claim we can’t sounds so stupid to me, I don’t know why everyone says that.
* some more complex phenomenon is involved. Maybe water evaporated from agriculture has a different life time. A few hours would be enough though. The amount of water evaporation is so much higher than the CO2... Also i don’t see why water vapor from humans would behave different than natural vapor. We are basically just wetting the earths surface. Then the sun does the rest in natural processes.

I think it’s more likely I did a mistake and that most of other scientists are right. However I didn’t find a flaw here. Most people I explained this to blamed me as a sceptic but didn’t have any scientific argument. I’m open to discussion but I hope you are open too and can consider my thoughts scientifically and neutrally even though it’s against the consensus.
Thank you.

Show Your Strips: Warming Stripes From 1901-2018 - Asia is clearly in trouble.,"Found a great site today called [Show Your Stripes](https://showyourstripes.info/) which visualized the average yearly temperatures, by country, from 1901 to 2018. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's part of a campaign called Show Your Stripes, which allows you to download country-by-country. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, given we are going to urbanize another 2b people in Asia, and we already have droughts having tangible impacts on large populations (urban and rural), I thought I would create a grid of Asian countries.

&amp;#x200B;

Once I did that, I thought I would pass it on for others to see/ use.

How Can I Fight Climate Change,"Hi All,

I am young (early 30s) and have made enough money to never work again. I would like to dedicate the rest of my life to fighting climate change and thought I’d ask you where my time would be best spent. 

My skill set is business related, rather than advocacy / politics or engineering / science so I am thinking I would be most effective setting up a company with the explicit purpose of fighting climate change and pushing all excess profits back into research. Do you agree with this? If so, what business would have the most impact that is not already well served?

I’ll add that I live in the Pacific Northwest between Canada and the US.

"If the greenhouse effect is causing global warming, wouldn't building a massive multi-square kilometer mirror/a network of millions of mirrors solve all problems?","Seeing some news about solar farms actually raising local weather temperatures due to the fact the black surfaces absorb so much heat has gotten me thinking

&amp;#x200B;

If a problem is the melting ice caps leading to more ocean, the dark surface absorbing more sunlight, and other problems involving the trapping of sunlight, mirrors would reflect light directly back into space.

So if we just covered several square kilometers of ocean or unused land (deserts already reflect a lot of sunlight) with floating mirrors/polish aluminum sheets, wouldn't this solve global warming? just paving land with aluminum foil or millions of floating foil-covered objects covering square kilometers of the ocean?

Are we still heading towards a RCP 8.5 World?,"I have a decent feeling that we'll be hitting peak carbon emissions soon. The coal industry is slowly crumbling, renewables such as solar are outpacing coal and are becoming exponentially cheaper. Many countries (and even US states) are beginning to lower emissions. Even China is supposedly peaking emissions soon as it replaces it's coal production with renewables as it transfers to a service economy. 

And yet, I'm hearing it'll take ~20 years for most of the coal plants currently running to be decomissioned. France is reporting 110 F weather in a bitter heatwave. I'm hearing that even our exponential progress with reducing emissions, bit by bit, are not enough to keep us under a 3 or 4 C future.

What makes climate change now different from previous periods of climate change?,"I should start out by saying I’m in no way trying to deny human-caused climate change! I’m just curious as to whether there are differences between climate change now and previous periods of climate change. 

I recently listened to a podcast on ice ages, and it explained how the planet has been through a lot of periods of warming and cooling. It got me thinking, life on earth has survived these periods and it seems fairly natural, so what makes the current period of man-made climate change different? I think it’s easiest to just list my questions below. 

1.) There’s a lot of talk of more extreme weather events because of climate change. Was this the case during periods of climate change hundreds of millions of years ago as well? Or is it specific to climate change now? 

2.) If the planet has already been through periods of climate change, is there anything that makes this period unique? Is it faster? Are the gases in the atmosphere different? 

3.) Is the reason climate change now is so bad because it’s also coupled with other human-caused phenomena like industrial agriculture and deforestation?

Secondly: If the IPCC isnt a reliable source of information regarding climate change, what is? where can I get information that is factual?  


Thirdly: How will climate change effect my life here in Ontario Canada? (20 years old)  


Lastly: I've been paralyzed with fear about climate change for the past several days. what should I do to help get past this?  


Any truthful information provided would be greatly appreciated. thank you."
Advice for jobs in this Area?,"Hi Everyone! 

I’ll apologise in advance for my naivety on the subject but I was hoping to gain some ideas. I’m really passionate about working to combat climate change but I’m just not sure how to go about that at the moment.

A bit about me: I have a Chemistry Masters from a well regarded university (UK) and I work in London as a lawyer in intellectual property - I’m mid-late twenties now. I work on the environment committee at my company and volunteer at an environmental charity as well. 

I just feel a change of career into something more fulfilling where I can spend the majority of my time working on combatting climate change would really excite me, and I’d like to think I can bring a lot to the industry. 

The types of schemes I find really interesting would be the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) and WWF One Planet Cities. I was wondering if anyone had further ideas I might find interesting when looking to apply. I’m also considering going back to university, either staying here in Europe or possibly heading to the US. 

I’ve only just started looking into this so any suggestions of courses, companies, jobs, etc. would be super helpful!

A thought about climate change.,"If you spill petrol on snow it melts.. It does try it.

So what if the snow melting is not global warming but something else??..

I have an idea what else it could be..

&amp;#x200B;

Imagine the smoke from all the cars?.. When the smoke blows all over the world the rain comes down and mixes with the smoke creating rain with petrol in it??.. And when it hits the floor its like spilling petrol all over the snow?..

But way milder than petrol ..watered down petrol.. Some say acid rain??..NO not acid rain.

&amp;#x200B;

Just think if you light a fire and pour pure water over the smoke the water is not pure anymore its mixed with the smoke.

And what ever is in the smoke will be in the water in less amounts because of the water added..

&amp;#x200B;

The fact its got nothing to do with the earth heating up.. Just pure water as in rain soaking it up and putting it back on the land with snow on it..  And smoke blows all over the place ..

&amp;#x200B;

More people in Canada .. Smoke getting blew all over Canada with the rain coming down will hit the snow and melt it faster.. Like petrol in the snow but diluted petrol from the rain pouring down..

&amp;#x200B;

Green land more smoke created ..Blows over the antarctica snow fall captures the smoke with petrol in it..

They call it acid rain   BUT  they sayits because of the earth heating up when it has nothing to do with the heat ..

&amp;#x200B;

It was all to do with the smoke..   Get smoke pour PURE WATER over it and test the water ..

And we have smoke blowing everywhere .. All over the world .. 

those parts it rains or snows will fall all over the smoke and melt the ice caps ..

&amp;#x200B;

Not one of the top 10 emitter countries meet its current Paris agreement target. Even if all the countries meet its current goals, that put us to a 3C warming ( [https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/12/07/climate/world-emissions-paris-goals-not-on-track.html](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/12/07/climate/world-emissions-paris-goals-not-on-track.html) ), very much short of hitting 2C, and 1.5C is basically a pipe dream. 

&amp;#x200B;

In fact, 6 of the top 10 emitter countries, including us, are in the highly/critically insufficient categories, which basically are emitting towards 3C+/4C+. 

&amp;#x200B;

And these are the ""easy"" goals. The basic premise for the Paris agreement is that reaching the ""easy"" goals will bootstrap countries to be more ambitious. Since almost no one who matters reaches the easy goals, there is little hope (at least for me) that we are going to reach the more ambitious ones. Some may wish for some miracle carbon capture tech that saves the day. But wishing is not a strategy. There is no indication that such a tech (and the necessary scale up) is going to be available soon.

&amp;#x200B;

And i also ask myself .. why no countries step up enough. The answer is clear. Humans are basically selfish and myopic. You can blame the politicians. But look at what the voters and the public chose in Brazil, Australia and even here in the US. Even the French yellow jackets are against a carbon tax. Basically people care more about their immediate livelihood than saving the planet (i.e. don't tax me and ask me to walk to work)

&amp;#x200B;

I am sure many are going to try to move minds. Many are going to create a lot of noises. Personally i do not believe we are going to avoid 2C+, probably 3C or even more .. given all the issues about permafrost de-frosing well in advance of projection. The good news is that in a rich country like the US, as long as I do not live close to the coast (which I do not, and will not), survival is probably not a problem. There will be addition heating/cooling and maintenance costs but the US (and other first world countries) will probably be fine.  I am certainly sad about the Fiji and other less fortunate people who are going to be impacted. But like what is happening in India now, i do not believe there is anything I can do. And yes, if everyone thinks like that, we are doomed ... but that is the point. Most human thinks like that. Selfishness is in our nature. Look up the classical tragedy of the common problem.

Dangers of air pollution - another argument for climate crisis?,"I've been reading a lot of information and debates on the climate crisis lately, and furthermore been finding a lot of people simply stating that greenhouse gases aren't an issue, all the scientific evidence is faked and flawed, that this isn't due to humans, etc. I often don't know where to start with debating these. I think part of that reason is that we have a lot of arguments and information, but it may be the same thing being used over and over again. Don't get me wrong, this is crucial and undeniable information. But if someone isn't going to listen to it, I figure I should think of a new way to debate it. 

So I've been thinking about some new points to use, specifically about carbon and other GHG emissions. Here's the one I think may be pretty solid:

**Greenhouse gases and air pollution are extremely dangerous to all people living in an effected area.** 

I think about large cities in countries such as India and China. These places have so much air pollution (which is quite obviously due to the human activity) and it is very harmful to the people there.

&gt;Dangerous weather conditions such a acid rain and smog have created hazards for Indian citizens. Acid rain contains hydrogen ions, which can damage trees, crops, harm marine animals and destroy metals. Sometimes the damage that is done from acid rain can be devastating. Smog causes harmful health effects in humans and animals.  Studies have shown signs of black lung disease in dolphins of due to high concentrations of carbon particles in the air. The effects of smog can be irreversible, impacting someone's future health greatly.  
Unfortunately, aside from strange yet dangerous weather, frequent exposure to polluted air increases the risk of cardiovascular disease. This restricts many Indians from exercising, since that's when air consumption is used more rapidly.  Breathing air that is filled with small particles can increase the chance of getting hardening of the arteries, triggering cardiac arrhythmia or even having a heart attack. Statistics show that annual premature deaths caused by particulate air pollution have increased by six times since the year 2000.

(quote from the India Pollution Project)

On top of this, the Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute in India found that 2.2 million Indian children are affected by lung damage that they will carry the rest of their lives - and a UNICEF report listed that air pollution is responsible for 600,00 deaths of Indian children below the age of five every year.

This is something caused by human activity and over emissions, and it is extremely harmful. What happens as countries such as the United States continue to spew so many GHGs into the atmosphere? It will create more dangerous conditions. I know it may not get as severe as these huge cities, mostly due to the really high population densities in these specific examples, but it still goes to show how these things are harmful and detrimental to everyone.

I don't want this to be seen as me saying that other things aren't true arguments, I just feel like we should introduce new ones to people who are truly dead set on denying previous ones. Maybe this isn't even a new idea, I just haven't heard it before in the climate change debate setting. So that's my idea. Is this a good argument? Does anyone have any things to add or point out?

What are your ideas for explaining the science of climate change as easily as possible?,"I was hoping we could have a discussion about easy ways to spread the science! I've noticed that the main issue I have in any climate change discussion is that I don't have enough time to properly explain the science in any way that has real impact. I was hoping /r/climatechange could help me solve this problem. If you have suggestions for other points or other ways to get across those points, I'll add them gladly! Try to be as short and impactful as possible. Here's some topics, and ideas that don't seem very effective because they're too long:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Why gases cause the climate to change:

&amp;#x200B;

(I've been told that this idea misrepesents the information by /u/deck_hand, although I personally think the cause and affect relationship is decent) We know a warm object in a cold room becomes cool, and a cold object in a warm room becomes warm. The earth is sort of like the opposite of a cooler. It keeps us warm in the absolute zero temperatures of space. The power source of this heater is the combination of gases covering the surface that trap heat emitted by the sun. Putting more of these gases into the atmosphere is the converse of putting more ice in the cooler, the planet gets more hot rather quickly.

&amp;#x200B;

From /u/Wallawallawallawa 

2. The reason this is multiplicative:

&amp;#x200B;

When you put ice in a cooler, the cooler and objects inside don't become instantly cold. No, the ice slowly heats up the surrounding air and the objects inside. Then, because it's a cooler, the ice stays frozen for a long while. Even when the ice begins to melt, the temperature doesn't reach above freezing until all of the ice has melted. Now apply that concept to the planet on a global scale. The planet slowly heats up over the course of years due to released emissions, then it will stay like heated while the gases stay trapped in our atmosphere. Whereas the ice melts in a few hours, because of the size of the planet, most of these gases won't leave our atmosphere for 100 years.

&amp;#x200B;

3. The reason it's detrimental:

&amp;#x200B;

Key points could possibly be; sea level rise, increased weather anomalies/anomaly severity with decreased predictability, why the small change in temperature has enough impact to kill off hundreds of species.

&amp;#x200B;

From /u/Wallawallawallawa:  We are currently on track for warming of close to 4 degrees Celsius by 2100. Temperatures have changed in the past too. The last 200 thousand years or so, we can clearly distinguish 6 ice ages. The last ice age resulted in a build up of a huge glacier across Northern US and Northern Europe. New York was buried under 1 km of ice. The ice reached higher than the skyscrapers do today. The global temperature difference then with respect to today: 4 degrees Celsius 

&amp;#x200B;

From /u/Macralicious:  A warming climate produces more extreme weather events, and this has a detrimental impact on our ability to grow food. Right now for example, huge swathes of farmland in the US are waterlogged and this season's crops are therefore in danger of failing. In the UK, the average size of potatoes was down, and in Italy they lost about 59% of their olive yield. They sound like ""cute"" stories, but both were attributed to more frequent extreme weather affecting the growth of the crops. If the anomalous weather becomes too frequent, the serious issue is obvious. This also affects wild animals, whose food sources will be disrupted.

&amp;#x200B;

~~4. Why we don't see the affects in a lot of the first world:~~

4. How different areas see different affects:

&amp;#x200B;

Should talk about the atmospheric system and how heat is distributed out around the planet from the equator, thus equatorial countries take the brunt. Could possibly bring up the increased rate of expansion of the Sahara. The changes then occurred over approx 10000 years. We're achieving the same increase in as little as 100 years.  

&amp;#x200B;

From /u/Macralicious:  The California wildfires, extreme cold across the Midwest last winter, all of the aforementioned crop growing issues. The reason we don't notice as much (in my opinion) is that most of the first world has relatively mild climates to begin with; the impacts of climate change are felt more in Africa for example because they were closer to the boundary of what's habitable in the first place. They also have lesser resources and infrastructure that would enable them to be robust against, and cope with, the anomalies.

&amp;#x200B;

5. How do we deal with complete discreditors?

&amp;#x200B;

From /u/Wallawallawallawa: Of course there is lobbying of green groups, but that doesn't mean they're wrong. And wouldn't you expect there to be more lobbying by powerful oil interests?""  Exxon instead buried this knowledge and ferociously lobbied against the it. All of this was uncovered by pulitzer prize nominated research journalism.

So that we could extract melting ice cap on the pole and use them for, i don't know, trying to kickstart terraforming Mars or something ?  

Since a lot of mad businessmen are more bothered about emigrating to Mars or creating robot overlord (ok, i'm half trolling here). Seriously though, is there any mad scientist actually researching that ?

Since i'm done believing in people managing to vote for some guy in every country that would do something about CO2, any dictator deciding they should think about their grand children... there ain't much more that can be done in time to avoid rising sea. Climate change might be more survivable without 300m rise in the sea level in the next 2 century. And honestly, except for ""magicaly"" making the problem diseapear, i don't see that not happening.

Study - Air temperature changes in the arctic from 1801 to 1920 -,"Link to the study:

https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/joc.1918

This is an overlooked study that comes to very different conclusions about past arctic temperatures than do proxy studies. 

Some key points:

 - ""On average, the Arctic as a whole was colder by 0.8C"" 

(Which is exactly the global rise reported today) 

 - ""Annual mean temperatures in all the 20-year periods and in all climatic regions were colder than today .... Differences generally are less  than  2C""

 - ""significantly colder autumns were observed in the period 1801 – 1860 in comparison with the
period 1861 – 1920."" 

(That lines up perfectly with LIA conditions)

 - ""The  greatest  discrepancies between the real Arctic and the Subarctic occurred in spring. The former was only a little colder than it is at present (by 0.2C), whereas the latter experienced quite significant cooling (by 1.1C)""

(That shows very little change near the pole and greater change in the sub-arctic. So, the spring melt was slower in most years than we see today}

 - ""... Canadian and Baffin Bay regions, where, on average, April was warmer than today by 0.3C. On the other hand, negative differences (−0.3C, i.e. colder conditions than present) were observed in the Atlantic
and Pacific regions.""

(This implies that there is far more regional variability in arctic temperature conditions than is generally noted)

 - ""The results show that air temperatures in the Arctic from 1801 to 1920 were not as exceptionally cold as has been suggested by some analyses of proxy data""

(So, modern reports of a major increase in arctic temperatures are likely exaggerated.)

 - ""Throughout the whole study period, the majority of mean monthly temperatures lie within one [SD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation) from the modern mean.""

(Which means that about 80% of the measurements are within a normal range of temperature variability)

Most significant is the conclusion that the period 1800-60 was colder in all arctic regions than the period 1861-1920. That means that warming was already occurring in the arctic and sub-arctic well before any warming could be attributed to human causes.",1,"Study - Air temperature changes in the arctic from 1801 to 1920 - Link to the study:

Climate Change Statistics,"Does anyone have links to research or statistics regarding corporate/commercial waste and pollution compared to individual waste and pollution?

I.E. - if I spent an entire 75-year lifetime recycling and reducing my waste, how much ""pollution"" (by whatever metric) have I ""saved,"" in comparison to much a given large polluting corporation puts out in any set time frame?

Hopefully someone gets what I'm trying to explain.",1,"Climate Change Statistics Does anyone have links to research or statistics regarding corporate/commercial waste and pollution compared to individual waste and pollution?

Climate change in Vietnam,"Hi, as South East Asia is ""deemed"" one of the most affected regions due to the upbringing of climate change recently, my school assigned me to do a project on Climate change adaptation in Vietnam and its affection on the Agriculture due to me being a Vietnamese. So I did some research on this and I want to ask the professionals to evaluate and maybe add to my research on this topic. Thank you. 

 

The downstream of the Mekong River in Vietnam conclude the largest areas to be severely affected by the consequences of ecological crisis. A national institute reported that salt-water intrusion had influenced many areas near Mekong River, the salt-water reached into about 70km mainland with an intensity of around 13-30%. Due to the low surface elevation level, high population density, and high dependencies of agriculture and aquaculture, it would have a severe impact on citizen lives and economics. A study shows that by 2100, sea level would rise by one meter, following that is 10% of the population is affected and an estimated 10% loss on the country GDP (Tran Duc, 2019).

In Ben Tre, a province-owned hydro station has measured to a significant rise of 25cm in sea level and drops in fresh rive outflows. At the same time, 4% salinity was recorded in the Co Chien River from 45-52 km inland in April 2013. The expectation for the 4% salinity up-river would have reached 40km in-land by 2040. This put Ben Tre in an unfavorable condition; it’s a province surrounded water, yet it’s inhabitable due to the lack of fresh water to sustain agricultural growth and human consumption (DANIDA, 2013).

Thua Thien Hue is in a critical state of a possible major natural disaster happening within the impact of climate change in recent years. Its terrain varies significantly from the mountain with a peak elevation of 500-1000m down to the plain with a mere 20m above sea level and the sea on the opposite side. As a result, the province only consists of 54% mainland with a tilt of over 25°; the rest is the oceans. Due to this topography, it is essentially creating a periodically consistent main flood which is separated into 4 main types of floods. Winter floods, Late floods, Early floods, and Summer floods. Collected data shows that major surges occur mostly during winter. (Shaw, 2006).

(Ir)rational fear of excessive resource use,"In parallel with the increasing amounts of GHGs that enter our atmosphere, we are also facing the risk of resource scarcity. This is because we (humans) are exploiting our planet's resources unsustainably. Recently, I've begun to be more considerate of this, and I try to limit myself in how much I ""consume"" on a daily basis. There are many aspects that can be discussed in this regard, but today I would like to focus on excessive water use.

I have lived in regions where water has been scarce, and I have learned to appreciate water more. For instance, I keep my showers short, I seldom use an electronic dishwasher (because I don't have enough dishes to fill it up, and therefore consider it wasteful), and I even avoid flushing the toilet if I only needed to pee. However, it sort of stresses me out when I see my friends and family ""waste"" water by taking very long showers (sometimes twice a day), using the dishwasher with only a few plates in (even when plates have only had dry bread crumbs on them), and flushing after every single visit to the toilet.

I know that one argument that can be used is ""well, a kg of meat uses X liters of water, so me taking a shower doesn't really matter"", and I understand and accept this as the harsh reality. However, my anxiety is more because the water we use in our homes are local resources (whereas the beef may have been produced on a different continent), and I am, I would say, ""afraid"" of running out of resources because people are wasteful. 

What are your thoughts on this? How can I get people to appreciate the resources we have and motivate them to use less, without coming across as an A-hole?",1,"(Ir)rational fear of excessive resource use In parallel with the increasing amounts of GHGs that enter our atmosphere, we are also facing the risk of resource scarcity.

The Power of Hope and it’s effect on human motivation.,"Hi all!

This is my first post on here, I came here after reading an extremely frightening report on climate change. 

Amongst all the doom and gloom I feel I must observe that throughout history, there have been many scenarios that have seemed hopeless, this might even be the biggest. However we have frequently overcame seemingly insurmountable odds due to hope, ingenuity and the strength of the human spirit. With the universe out there, the solutions exist. 

A social tipping point is coming, progress has new reinforcements everyday while the powers that oppose progress fight a war on two fronts, with progress and the grave. 

If we can all raise awareness and be prepared to begin an industrial and economic green revolution within the next five years we have a chance, we still have the exponential growth of technology to contribute to our efforts. Our futures here CAN be saved, and I have every confidence that they WILL BE. If you don’t have faith in anything else, have faith in the Power of Hope. 

Just to illustrate my point, with exception of those with no means of accessing the knowledge that our climate is changing for the worse, all the most intelligent people in the world across 100s of fields and in nearly all places believe in climate change, so when it comes down to it something will be attempted and it will and should be on a massive scale. 

Good luck everyone!",1,"The Power of Hope and it’s effect on human motivation. Hi all!

My Opinion,"Most of the people around me in my daily life don’t care about climate change whatsoever. However, I personally find it quite disturbing. The thought of a changing globe and the conflicts and problems that come with it, such as rising oceans and and increased extreme weather events make me feel guilty for being one of the contributors to such a horrendous event.
  
Global warming is almost definitely going to happen, and even the naysayers must agree that any work done to prevent climate change could only lead to a healthier planet in the long run. Yet many people choose to ignore al the evidence piling up, such as rising temperatures, sea levels, increased numbers of extreme weather events, and the fact that all these seem to coincide with the massive amounts of greenhouse gases we release into the atmosphere every year. 

I have decided that I will try and reduce my own emissions if no one near me will, if not to set an example then to simply reduce my own guilt. I will reduce the amount of meat I eat and the emissions I emit by driving by using active and public transportation more frequently, as my current lifestyle doesn’t follow a “healthier planet” vision.

Carbon pricing for other green house gasses,"How would carbon pricing for methane (86 GWP/20yr), HCF (3790 GWP/20yr), CFC (7020 GWP/20yr), N2O (269 GWP/20yr), and CF4 (4950 GWP/20yr) work?

What types of man made or natural events would cause a huge jump in global temps?,"Hi all!

&amp;#x200B;

So, I'm writing a book that is set 100 years from now (well, 90ish years). It's got dystopic and apocalyptic themes.. and I was wondering what types of environmental changes would occur in 100 years. I'd like to have the environment play a neat effect in my book, man vs nature, all that jazz. But if it's out of the realm of plausible fiction... then I'll cut that idea.

&amp;#x200B;

**So as for the real question, I was just curious as to what types of events-- any! it could be man-made, environmental, or totally fictional!-- would cause global temperatures to jump to a point that it would change the world around us -- sea levels rising, crops and overall agriculture being affected.** 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm writing in the overall history of my universe right now. My setting is North America, most specifically the Midwest and moving east. I've created a 2030 map that has the US, Canada, and Mexico borders... but i also made a general 2109 map.. where I've made some guesses as to sea levels rising (to a point want as a writer), and I changed country borders and such.

All of this to say, I'm trying to map out the changes in North America and I need some guidelines from people who are smarter than me lmao.",1,"What types of man made or natural events would cause a huge jump in global temps? Hi all!

What ive learned about climate change from social media,"Researching solely about climate change from Reddit, here is what ive learned about climate change and my thoughts/viewpoints about it.

__What have you found out about climate change?__

I have found that climate change has become an issue that most people don't usually think about in their daily lives.

Climate change affects not only humans, but wildlife and vegetation. This has been shown through the extinction of certain species.

__What conclusions have you made?__

I have concluded that the affects of climate change are everywhere and people need to change their lifestyles because of it.

__What did you base your conclusions off of?__

I based my conclusion from what I've seen in my every day life, and from what I've seen happens when we continue to cause climate change from our own actions.

__How do your actions affect climate change?__

My actions affect climate change by a small amount, things like not using single use plastics and reducing our energy use. What makes a difference is advising our friends, family, community, and more about what they can do to prevent climate change. If we all change the way we live, (reduce the amount of fossil fuels burned by using more efficient furnaces,etc.) We can make a change.",1,"What ive learned about climate change from social media Researching solely about climate change from Reddit, here is what ive learned about climate change and my thoughts/viewpoints about it.

clean energy question,"Okay so here's the deal, both my grandfathers are very accomplished physicists. While one worked primarily with composites and material science in the French aerospace industry and later NASA and has friends who have worked in nuclear physics. The other has an impressive array of publications in thermo mechanics, collisions etc... mainly in the civil engineering area, namely roads. In the past he has worked on an US/FRA exchange program with the Los Alamos laboratory to compare and exchange data in nuclear physics (probably bombs), he has met original scientists from the Manhattan project including Oppenheimer unless I'm very much mistaken and is good friends with Robert Dautray who is the father of the French bomb.

Both of are pro nuclear and believe nuclear energy is the cleanest we have and will have for a long time to come and considering their background and wealth of knowledge I can't see any reason to not believe them. Having done my own research I believe a combination of nuclear and hydro electric power would be a perfect to have clean renewable energy. So why are law makers backing out of nuclear so much when it is the safest cleanest energy we have available. Heck if I remember my figures correctly Germany's emissions went UP when they stopped the 'reactors. France and Sweden continue to have very low carbon emissions from their power plants for these reasons. I'm pretty sure that the law makers surround themselves with the right people so why are they shutting down nuclear power plants? Why is there not  more education on how nuclear energy works and how safe it is. This confuses me. Why would you turn your back on a highly scalable form of power that happens to be clean and safe.

"""There is a runaway train racing toward us, and its name is climate change""...is not a scientific fact, it's the opposite","Recently a journalistic conference was convened in America (jointly by the *Columbia Journalism Review* and the *The Nation*) to survey the state of American journalism on climate change. 

Criticisms of US coverage abounded — but the criticisms also abounded with errors. In the keynote article ""[The Media Are Complacent While the World Burns](https://www.cjr.org/special_report/climate-change-media.php)"" one finds this passage:

&gt;There is a runaway train racing toward us, and its name is climate change. That is not alarmism; it is scientific fact. 

This statement is definitely NOT a statement of scientific fact — which doesn't deal in metaphors like runaway trains. The statement qualifies as magical thinking at least, and probably alarmism too.

Conference participants presumably had some more substantive criticisms of US climate coverage. Although I bet hardly any of them were more substantive than Chris Hayes' observation from 2018:

&gt; Hayes (who is an editor at large for *The Nation*) replied that his program had tried. Which was true: in 2016, “All In With Chris Hayes” spent an entire week highlighting the impact of climate change in the US as part of a look at the issues that Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump were ignoring. The problem, Hayes tweeted, was that “every single time we’ve covered [climate change] it’s been a palpable ratings killer. So the incentives are not great.”

American journalism covers climate in three distinct ways: 

1) Validating the beliefs of the Climate Denier audience, with the most spectacular assertions one can find which possess a minimum amount of scientific support.  

2) Validating the beliefs of the Climate Doomer audience, with the most spectacular assertions one can find which possess a minimum amount of scientific support. This is what's happening with the ""runaway train"" quote here.

3) Serving the audience which is actually interested in the science of climate. This audience doesn't have many beliefs which go beyond what can be shown by analytic methods. The real task of this strain of journalism is to expand the range of what can be shown by analytic methods. It's probably best to call this strain ""(actual) science journalism,"" rather than mainstream journalism.

It's stupid to fault American journalism (or any journalism) for serving the first two audiences. That's the explicit task of much mainstream journalism: To serve and form a relationship with the largest audience they can reach. Many people are more interested in having their beliefs validated than in having them analyzed (or challenged). These audiences will always exist.

The real question is: How large is that third audience? Is there a chance that it might grow to the size of the other two? If it does, then mainstream journalism will have to yield some space to more ""(actual) science journalism.""

But the keynote article for the CJR/Nation conference gives me no hope that *that* particular set of journalism watchers intends to take a single step in that direction. They're in the validating-beliefs mode, not the analytical mode. 

Plenty of analytical-mode writers publish all the time. There's no need to pay a single moment's attention to the largest mainstream outlets (for instance, network television news operations). But you have to search for them. And complaining about the belief-validating sections of the media doesn't actually make the search easier.",1,"""There is a runaway train racing toward us, and its name is climate change""...is not a scientific fact, it's the opposite Recently a journalistic conference was convened in America (jointly by the *Columbia Journalism Review* and the *The Nation*) to survey the state of American journalism on climate change.

How can an individual engineer have the biggest impact on climate change? (x-post from /r/askengineers),"Hey, looking for a little advice for a friend.  She has a driving need to work to reverse climate change and is trying to figure out the best way to do that.  Do you have any advice for what could be the way that she can have the most impact?

&amp;#x200B;

She has a masters in EE from a top-tier university and has been working in hardware validation for a couple years.  She's also a capable programmer and has been shifting her role to include more CS.  But her current job has nothing to do with the environment or climate change, and she's finding it to be quite a drag.

&amp;#x200B;

Right now, her (incomplete) plan is to go back to school to study chemical engineering, then use that degree as a way to get a job in clean tech.  The long-term goal is to work on carbon capture or trying to remove plastics from the ocean.  It seems to me there are a lot of unknown and undefined steps in her plan.

&amp;#x200B;

So here are a few of my questions:

1. What's the best way for a young, capable engineer to have an impact on climate change work?
2. Is a degree in chemical engineering a good first step, or would it be a waste of time?

Information on carbon emissions by individual companies?,"Hi there,  


I was wondering if anyone knew where to find information on individual companies on their carbon footprint.

  
For example, this article I was reading on McDonald's said they would reduce their carbon footprint by 30% or so, and calculated the resulting metric tons of carbon emissions that would be reduced. This suggests that the current total carbon emissions by McDonald's is known. I can't seem to find this kind of information though anywhere, so I'm not sure where the article got these numbers.  


If anyone could let me know, would be greatly appreciated!

A Deep Dive into Solar Panels.,"12.3 million. The number of homes solar panels were able to power in the US at the end of 2018. Whenever conferring with others about the energy source of the future, solar energy is almost always brought alight. Solar energy is rapidly expanding around the world, as the push for clean energy spreads across the globe. Behind solar energy are solar panels: the panels that absorb sunlight as a source of energy to create electricity for our needs. Ever since 1839, solar panels have been changing constantly and improving greatly to better coincide with the push for 100% clean, renewable energy. The talk around solar panels for the future of the world is undeniably a great amount, but it is also important to acknowledge the history of solar panels, how they work, and their current day status. 
 
Solar energy has been around ever since ancient civilization, but it wasn’t anything like the conventional solar panels seen today used to harness the sun’s energy. It wasn’t until the 1800s when the ball got rolling and solar energy was starting to form like a newly born star in the solar system. Solar energy all started based off an earth-shattering 1839 discovery found by French physicist, Edmond Becquerel. This discovery consisted of the finding of the photovoltaic effect, “a process that generates voltage or electric current in a photovoltaic cell when it is exposed to sunlight,” as Energy Education puts it. Additionally, the discovery of the photovoltaic effect was found while Becquerel was conducting research with a cell comprised of metal electrodes in a conducting solution. Consequently, Becquerel would exclaim, “shining light on an electrode submerged in a conductive solution would create an electric current,” in reference to discovering the photovoltaic effect. Later, in 1873, Willoughby Smith stumbled upon the photoconductivity of selenium, now used in solar panels today. Moreover, in 1876, William Grylls Adams and Richard Evans Day put the photovoltaic idea (originally found by Becquerel) to selenium, finding it could generate electricity when light hit it. To no one’s surprise, someone would eventually put all three discoveries to life which is exactly what happened in 1883, when Charles Fritts created the first ever working selenium cell. Charles Fritts’ newly made cell was an ingenious invention at the time, as he hoped it would compete with Edison’s coal-fired power plants. On the contrary, the new, innovative selenium cell was less than 1% efficient and had no chance of competing with Edison’s coal-fired power plants as the solar cell wasn’t a feasible way of powering millions of peoples lives. Generally, the idea of solar energy wasn’t a popular one at the time and wouldn’t be for a while. Eventually, the concept of solar energy was brought alight when Albert Einstein published a paper on the photoelectric effect and how light carries energy, happening in 1905. Hence, Albert Einstein would win The Nobel Prize in Physics 1921, “For his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect.” He would receive the prize a year later, in 1922.
 
 With the concept of solar energy gaining steam, more specifically the photoelectric and photovoltaic effect, it wasn’t until 1941 when Russell Ohl broke the barrier and invented the solar cell; different than the selenium cell invented by Charles Fritts in 1883. Similarly, like Fritts’ selenium cell, the new solar cell invented by Russell Ohl was incredibly ineffective and not a feasible option to power the lives of many at the time. The energy conversion efficiency of the cell was only 1%, thus for every 100 Joules of solar energy hitting the cell, only 1 Joule of electrical energy was created. While this was an improvement from Fritts’ cell, it wasn’t enough to be used as a legitimate source of energy worldwide, as previously mentioned. The most groundbreaking, substantial invention didn’t come until 1954, when the modern day photovoltaic cell was invented by Daryl Chapin, Calvin Fuller, and Gerald Pearson. After months of long, grueling work, the final product was the first feasible silicon cell ever invented. Originally, Daryl Chapin wanted to make a source of power for telephone systems in remote areas, therefore turning to solar energy as the option. He would later collaborate with Calvin Fuller and Gerald Pearson, as they all invented the cell in unity. Truly, this was the cell of the future as the newly invented cell had a 6% conversion efficiency, much more than the 1941 solar cell invented by Russell Ohl or the 1883 selenium cell invented by Charles Fritts. In fact, the solar call had so much potential The New York Times wrote the newly invented silicon cell, “may mark the beginning of a new era, leading eventually to the realization of one of mankind’s most cherished dreams–the harnessing of the almost limitless energy of the sun for the uses of civilization.” Even though the cell was way too costly at the time to be used by the public or companies (the solar cells costed over $100 per watt), the US military decided to fund research on the cells for the potential to power satellites in the 1950s. The funding persited, and the first ever spacecraft to use solar panels ended up being the Vanguard I in 1958. For some time, solar was still too costly for use until Dr. Elliot Berman did extensive research and was able to produce a much less expensive solar cell, bringing the cost per watt down to just $20, in the early 1970s. Coincidentally, in 1973, the energy crisis hit the US which made oil prices skyrocket forcing the US to turn to other energy options, like solar. In turn, this made the US government committed to developing solar energy (solar panels in specific) as a feasible source of energy for future uses. As a result, Jimmy Carter decided to install solar panels on the roof of the White House to spread awareness and to make a solar energy statement. Evidently, solar panels started to become more feasible as the “golden era” of solar panels for the 1900s hit in the 1980s. 
 
During the 1980s, solar panels started to become much more efficient and cheaper through research and developments. By the 1990s, many groundbreaking creations came out which helped fuel solar panel growth. For example, in 1992, the University of South Florida developed a 15.9% efficient thin-film photovoltaic cell made of cadmium telluride. Just a short time after, in 1994, the first ever solar cell exceeding 30% conversion efficiency was made. 5 years later, in 1999, a photovoltaic solar cell was developed that converted 32.3% of the sunlight that hits it into electricity. Also in 1999,  the new efficiency record for photovoltaic thin-film solar cells was hit marking in at 18.8%. In total, growth between the 1980s and 1990s was crucial to solar panels expanding. Just in 1983, the worldwide photovoltaic production was 21.3 megawatts. In 1999, that number increased to 1,000 megawatts. In conclusion, it is clear the history of solar panels was jammed packed and certainly fascinating indeed. 
 
Today, solar panels work in a very specific way. For solar panels to work, sunlight must be hitting the panel. Obviously, if there is no sun, the solar panels won’t be working at that specific moment. This is why at night, solar panels aren’t working like they are in the day. Anyway, soon after the sun hits the panel, the photovoltaic solar cell absorbs the radiation from the sun. For the sun to hit the cell, it must go through the frame, glass, and encapsulant which makes up the solar panel. Once the sun does hit the cell, after passing through the first stages of the solar panel, electrons begin to move around internally. Nevertheless, a solar cell consists of a layer of p-type silicon placed next to a layer of n-type silicon which are sandwiched between two silicon layers. Inside the n-type, there is an excess of electrons while inside the p-type, there is an excess of positively charged holes. Between the n-type silicon layer and the p-type silicon layer, there is the depletion zone where electrons fill the holes. Once this is completed, the p-type of the depletion zone now contains negatively charged ions while the n-type consists of positively charged ions. Moreover, this creates an electric field which prevents electrons in the n-type layer to fill the holes in the p-type layer. Finally, when sunlight hits the cell, electrons in the holes are ejected resulting in the formation of the holes. All in all, when the p-type and n-type layers are connected with metallic wire or any wire that can generate electric current, the electrons will travel from the sides creating electricity. In a residential solar makeup, the solar panels convert the sunlight into DC energy which is then transferred to an inverter which transfers the electricity to AC for use. For all energy not needed, it goes back to the grid. In conclusion, solar panels aren’t too complicated and work following a basic method. Without the method present, solar panels wouldn’t be able to function as they do. 
 
In today’s era, solar panels are becoming increasingly more prominent and have been over the last few years. In the last decade alone, solar has experienced an average annual growth rate of 50% amongst the US. Furthermore, there are currently over 240,000 Americans working in the solar industry with over 10,000 companies per state. In discussion with cost, the cost to install solar has rapidly dropped by more than 70% in the last decade with the average price per watt only being anywhere from $2.67 to $3.43 now. Comparing the prices to 70 years ago, there is a huge difference in cost. Currently, most solar is installed in Europe and East Asia which account for over 70% of global installations. The least happens to be in Africa, accounting for less than 1% of total global installations. Installations have been growing like wildfire ever since a jump in 2010. In 2000, there were no installations of solar in the US whatsoever. By 2016, the yearly installation reached almost 14,000 watts across residential PV (photovoltaic), non-residential PV, Utility PV, and Utility CSP. The US has also been emphasizing solar, with the annual additions of new electric capacity always growing each year ever since 2010. In 2010, that number was just 4%. In 2018, it was 29% out of all possible energies. Nevertheless, in the US, California has been a big player in solar with the most installations out of any state coming from California. In fact, California beats the next 9 states combined in terms of annual residential PV installations. By January 1st, 2020, California is making it mandatory for all new homes to come installed with solar panels. In terms of efficiency, most solar panels have above 20% conversion levels now. There are actually 7 different types of solar panels, with different types varying per company. Finally, solar panels can be found in solar farms, on residential homes, and commercial homes primarily. It is good to note solar farms are the most effective ways for solar panels to work and the most prominent way. To illustrate how solar is truly on the rise, the global solar energy sector is projected to reach $422 billion by 2022 up from $86 billion in 2016, according to Allied Market Research. In conclusion, it is clear solar panels are on the rise and becoming the energy choice of the future. Within 10 years, solar will have expanded greatly around the world like it has in the past 10. 
 
Clearly, the history of solar panels is quite eventful, the way they work is very fascinating and complex, and their current day status is very promising. Without solar panels in life, the world would suffer major losses without one of the most popular clean energy options around. Not only this, renewable energy would have to be limited to the current day, less promising options like wind energy. Jobs would also be lost, the economy wouldn’t be the same, and solar companies would seize to exist. In a world without solar panels, what would it be like?

 With the concept of solar energy gaining steam, more specifically the photoelectric and photovoltaic effect, it wasn’t until 1941 when Russell Ohl broke the barrier and invented the solar cell; different than the selenium cell invented by Charles Fritts in 1883. Similarly, like Fritts’ selenium cell, the new solar cell invented by Russell Ohl was incredibly ineffective and not a feasible option to power the lives of many at the time. The energy conversion efficiency of the cell was only 1%, thus for every 100 Joules of solar energy hitting the cell, only 1 Joule of electrical energy was created. While this was an improvement from Fritts’ cell, it wasn’t enough to be used as a legitimate source of energy worldwide, as previously mentioned. The most groundbreaking, substantial invention didn’t come until 1954, when the modern day photovoltaic cell was invented by Daryl Chapin, Calvin Fuller, and Gerald Pearson. After months of long, grueling work, the final product was the first feasible silicon cell ever invented. Originally, Daryl Chapin wanted to make a source of power for telephone systems in remote areas, therefore turning to solar energy as the option. He would later collaborate with Calvin Fuller and Gerald Pearson, as they all invented the cell in unity. Truly, this was the cell of the future as the newly invented cell had a 6% conversion efficiency, much more than the 1941 solar cell invented by Russell Ohl or the 1883 selenium cell invented by Charles Fritts. In fact, the solar call had so much potential The New York Times wrote the newly invented silicon cell, “may mark the beginning of a new era, leading eventually to the realization of one of mankind’s most cherished dreams–the harnessing of the almost limitless energy of the sun for the uses of civilization.” Even though the cell was way too costly at the time to be used by the public or companies (the solar cells costed over $100 per watt), the US military decided to fund research on the cells for the potential to power satellites in the 1950s. The funding persited, and the first ever spacecraft to use solar panels ended up being the Vanguard I in 1958. For some time, solar was still too costly for use until Dr. Elliot Berman did extensive research and was able to produce a much less expensive solar cell, bringing the cost per watt down to just $20, in the early 1970s. Coincidentally, in 1973, the energy crisis hit the US which made oil prices skyrocket forcing the US to turn to other energy options, like solar. In turn, this made the US government committed to developing solar energy (solar panels in specific) as a feasible source of energy for future uses. As a result, Jimmy Carter decided to install solar panels on the roof of the White House to spread awareness and to make a solar energy statement. Evidently, solar panels started to become more feasible as the “golden era” of solar panels for the 1900s hit in the 1980s. 
 
During the 1980s, solar panels started to become much more efficient and cheaper through research and developments. By the 1990s, many groundbreaking creations came out which helped fuel solar panel growth. For example, in 1992, the University of South Florida developed a 15.9% efficient thin-film photovoltaic cell made of cadmium telluride. Just a short time after, in 1994, the first ever solar cell exceeding 30% conversion efficiency was made. 5 years later, in 1999, a photovoltaic solar cell was developed that converted 32.3% of the sunlight that hits it into electricity. Also in 1999,  the new efficiency record for photovoltaic thin-film solar cells was hit marking in at 18.8%. In total, growth between the 1980s and 1990s was crucial to solar panels expanding. Just in 1983, the worldwide photovoltaic production was 21.3 megawatts. In 1999, that number increased to 1,000 megawatts. In conclusion, it is clear the history of solar panels was jammed packed and certainly fascinating indeed. 
 
Today, solar panels work in a very specific way. For solar panels to work, sunlight must be hitting the panel. Obviously, if there is no sun, the solar panels won’t be working at that specific moment. This is why at night, solar panels aren’t working like they are in the day. Anyway, soon after the sun hits the panel, the photovoltaic solar cell absorbs the radiation from the sun. For the sun to hit the cell, it must go through the frame, glass, and encapsulant which makes up the solar panel. Once the sun does hit the cell, after passing through the first stages of the solar panel, electrons begin to move around internally. Nevertheless, a solar cell consists of a layer of p-type silicon placed next to a layer of n-type silicon which are sandwiched between two silicon layers. Inside the n-type, there is an excess of electrons while inside the p-type, there is an excess of positively charged holes. Between the n-type silicon layer and the p-type silicon layer, there is the depletion zone where electrons fill the holes. Once this is completed, the p-type of the depletion zone now contains negatively charged ions while the n-type consists of positively charged ions. Moreover, this creates an electric field which prevents electrons in the n-type layer to fill the holes in the p-type layer. Finally, when sunlight hits the cell, electrons in the holes are ejected resulting in the formation of the holes. All in all, when the p-type and n-type layers are connected with metallic wire or any wire that can generate electric current, the electrons will travel from the sides creating electricity. In a residential solar makeup, the solar panels convert the sunlight into DC energy which is then transferred to an inverter which transfers the electricity to AC for use. For all energy not needed, it goes back to the grid. In conclusion, solar panels aren’t too complicated and work following a basic method. Without the method present, solar panels wouldn’t be able to function as they do. 
 
In today’s era, solar panels are becoming increasingly more prominent and have been over the last few years. In the last decade alone, solar has experienced an average annual growth rate of 50% amongst the US. Furthermore, there are currently over 240,000 Americans working in the solar industry with over 10,000 companies per state. In discussion with cost, the cost to install solar has rapidly dropped by more than 70% in the last decade with the average price per watt only being anywhere from $2.67 to $3.43 now. Comparing the prices to 70 years ago, there is a huge difference in cost. Currently, most solar is installed in Europe and East Asia which account for over 70% of global installations. The least happens to be in Africa, accounting for less than 1% of total global installations. Installations have been growing like wildfire ever since a jump in 2010. In 2000, there were no installations of solar in the US whatsoever. By 2016, the yearly installation reached almost 14,000 watts across residential PV (photovoltaic), non-residential PV, Utility PV, and Utility CSP. The US has also been emphasizing solar, with the annual additions of new electric capacity always growing each year ever since 2010. In 2010, that number was just 4%. In 2018, it was 29% out of all possible energies. Nevertheless, in the US, California has been a big player in solar with the most installations out of any state coming from California. In fact, California beats the next 9 states combined in terms of annual residential PV installations. By January 1st, 2020, California is making it mandatory for all new homes to come installed with solar panels. In terms of efficiency, most solar panels have above 20% conversion levels now. There are actually 7 different types of solar panels, with different types varying per company. Finally, solar panels can be found in solar farms, on residential homes, and commercial homes primarily. It is good to note solar farms are the most effective ways for solar panels to work and the most prominent way. To illustrate how solar is truly on the rise, the global solar energy sector is projected to reach $422 billion by 2022 up from $86 billion in 2016, according to Allied Market Research. In conclusion, it is clear solar panels are on the rise and becoming the energy choice of the future. Within 10 years, solar will have expanded greatly around the world like it has in the past 10. 
 
Clearly, the history of solar panels is quite eventful, the way they work is very fascinating and complex, and their current day status is very promising. Without solar panels in life, the world would suffer major losses without one of the most popular clean energy options around. Not only this, renewable energy would have to be limited to the current day, less promising options like wind energy. Jobs would also be lost, the economy wouldn’t be the same, and solar companies would seize to exist. In a world without solar panels, what would it be like?

"Supercritical CO2, closed loop Geothermal wells and the promise of universal carbon free base load Renewable power","Yesterday I posted a link to  DOE review of the untapped potential of Geothermal power Plants.  this post is in response to questions posed in comments to that post.

"As a layman, I believe the main killer of climate change will be all the wars it spurs","I've always said the science behind global climate change, appears to pretty solid, and to me talking to a climate change denier is like debating a flat earther.

I want to run this idea past a couple people on here.

Basically Homo Sapiens is 200,000 years old. Besides maybe ideology, and religion, what has been a main motivating factor for wars? Limited resources, and power and control over those resources. When I play Civ V, I gotta delay my civilization's progress if I aim to take out another, but on a cost/benefit analysis that rival civilization's resources are main motivating factor. And I think we got a similar situation here.

We got 7.6 billion people. Population numbers continuing to rise. This can NOT rise indefinitely. And not when climate change is actually going to affect land areas, I.E. where humans live, profoundly more than out in the middle of the ocean, I suspect land is actually going to get a lot hotter than say 4c.

It's not so much the farm lands being turned to desert and displacement of hundreds of millions from coastal cities that scares me...I think this climate change is going to set off potentially the proverbial WWIII. You're gonna have starving masses similar to Soylent Green, they're going to be pissed. We're seeing the rise of nationalists, I'm not getting into politics, but basically instead of humans figuring out a way to share the earth's resources for their survival, they're looking to horde them to themselves. It's the rise of authoritarianism and a look to strong man dictatorships in major countries, that is leading me to see parallel's to the lead up to the WWII situation, except today's weapons are profoundly more destructive than they were in the 1940's.

IIRC they say one of the reasons we may have yet to ever discover intelligent life is because it figured out how to destroy itself, before it figured out interstellar travel. Right now we got the nuclear arsenal the world over to destroy ourselves as opposed to interstellar travel.

So I just wanted to see what others think of this idea of mine.",1,"As a layman, I believe the main killer of climate change will be all the wars it spurs I've always said the science behind global climate change, appears to pretty solid, and to me talking to a climate change denier is like debating a flat earther.

Why are some people so resolutely opposed to accepting climate change,"i have been posting on many topics  on a different forum for quite a while.  I have done a few posts on climate change. And have noticed that many people are seemingly irrationally opposed to consideration of evidence on the topic.

The most recent topic that i chose was sea level rise. I chose this topic because it seemed to me that the evidence of sea level rise is indisputable.  Not only are sea levels rising, they are rising at an accelerating rate.   ( from 1.8 mm per year in 1900 to about 3.5 mm per year recently)  I asked a simple question:  what is causing this phenomenon?

To me, the only possible explanation is added heat from greenhouse gasses.   But i was open to any alternative explanation that might be proposed.  I got answers like... sedimentation is causing sea level rise, and seismic activity may be reducing the size of ocean basins.  Both of these explanations are easily dismissed since they are long term and constant and therefore could not account for a short term acceleration of sea level rise.  I have had someone argue that in order to accept air temperature readings there would have to be millions  of ground stations all read by a single individual. I have had people argue that any co2 mitigation strategy... no matter how small... would result in the collapse of the world economy. And of course there is the persistent meme that all of the scientists in the world are part if a gigantic plot that requires that the keep producing phony studies in order to line their pockets with government grants.

I have to say that the people proposing these arguments are clearly intelligent, and not obviously insincere.   I find it confounding that they seem to be so rooted in their opposition to this topic that no amount of patience, or rationality will dislodge them from their intractable opposition to open minded consideration of the evidence.

How does irrigation affect the climate?,"Water is one of the most important things related to the climate, but I've hardly ever heard talk about irrigation and climate change. But surely irrigation has an effect one way or another, about 2,700,000,000,000,000 liters of water are used for irrigation. Water vapor is a powerful greenhouse gas but precipitates out quickly; clouds, snow, and ice have high albedo; water weathers rocks absorbing CO2; water helps plants absorb CO2; irrigating areas changes their albedo; plants release water via evapotranspiration. 

An example of water vapor being dependent on land use is the Amazon rainforest, which is mostly self-watering by absorbing and transpiring rainwater. Farmland also changes the local water vapor concentration, by irrigating, by forming the land to absorb water rather than have runoff, and by changing rates of evapotranspiration compared to wildland.

Food Towers as a Method to Futureproof?,"Guys,
I've been thinking, and this is what I've thought. As it stands, all we need in life is food, water and shelter, and efficiency is key. I believe the society we live in (I speak as an Australian) is geared towards burning energy to stimulate an economy. Without business, managing the cost of living would become near impossible and many would suffer. The problem I forsee is that the business we promote is unsustainable for the environment and also for ourselves, and we will ultimately run ourselves into the ground. 

[tldr] So here is my idea... Why don't we condense our populus into towers, each of which can support its own capacity of residents through hydroponics. I fear we will be forced to retreat indoors if we leave this climate change issue for too long, and this is a solution I believe could work. 

I would love to hear from each and every one of you, with your thoughts about this and ideas on the topic.

Idea I had,"Remember in 2014 when people were posting video’s of them emptying a bucket of ice over their head everywhere for ALS and people all around the world started doing it and nominating their friends?
What if we started something similar, like for example someone plants a tree, posts pictures of it on social media and nominates their friends to do the same.
The main excuse people have when you ask them why they don’t eat less meat or something like that is that one person isn’t going to save the world. This challenge fixes that problem, as planting just one tree and nominating your friends who in turn nominate other people can create a huge chain reaction.
I’m just curious to know if something like this is doable and what you guys think about this idea.",1,"Idea I had Remember in 2014 when people were posting video’s of them emptying a bucket of ice over their head everywhere for ALS and people all around the world started doing it and nominating their friends?

How does CO2 causes earth to heat up?,"Does anyone have good scientific facts on how CO2 causes global warming?

Air is 21% oxygen, 78% nitrogen and 0.04% CO2. CO2 has gone from 300 ppm to  415 ppm in last century and could get to  500ppm soon. While this is a huge increase in CO2 it is still a very small fraction of the air.  There is not much difference in 0.04% and 0.05%

For sure CO2 gas is a better insulator than  nitrogen or  oxygen. I believe O and N  have r value of about 0.97 per inch while CO2 is 1.5.  However given the small percentage of CO2 in the air,  i suspect it would not change the overall insulation properties of air.

CO2 can absorb infrared radiation whereas oxygen and nitrogen do not. However, again since CO2 makes up such a small fraction of air, I can't see this making huge change in earth's temperature.

The most interesting theories I have heard relate to how CO2 amplifies the amount of  water vapour that air can hold. Since water vapor and clouds have a huge effect on earths temperature this sounds more plausible. The only way I understand how C02 effects water vapour is that CO2 will warm the air, thus warm air holds more moisture. Again we are back to the small percentage of CO2 and could that small percentage have a large impact on the airs moisture content. Maybe there are other interactions at play.

Does anyone have additional info that could help clarify?",1,"How does CO2 causes earth to heat up? Does anyone have good scientific facts on how CO2 causes global warming?

Upwards temperature spiral after 1.5C,So I have seen someone talk about in a YT Video that there is a risk once we reach 1.5C that the temperature will spiral up uncontrollably. That once we reach 1.5C we lose any control of temperature (with the output of less CO2). I have yet to find sources that prove this or explain it. The Sources linked have to be paid so I have not read them. This makes this post kinda stupid but I still wanna know if it is true and why the relationship between CO2 in the atmosphere and the global temperature change at 1.5C.,1,Upwards temperature spiral after 1.5C So I have seen someone talk about in a YT Video that there is a risk once we reach 1.5C that the temperature will spiral up uncontrollably.

How do we know Earth's orbital patterns are not effecting climate change more than humans?,"I know I might get some flack here, and I think we should be doing everything we can to stop the hazardous pollution of our planet, but I am just not convinced it is solely humans that are responsible for the current warming we are seeing. In my recent research I have come across many other natural processes that could lead to the warming of our planet. The history of the climate of this planet is actually far from stable, as only 10,000 years ago, our planet was in a full blown ice age, that we still don't fully understand how it got out of. The orbit of the earth is also very diverse. Aside from the regular orbit and rotation on its axis that cause the 4 seasons, there are factors such as milankovitch cycles, axial obliquity, axial &amp; apsidal precession, and eccentricity to name a few, that could all be effecting how the heat from the sun is dispersed on the surface of our planet, just in a much more subtle way (every 10,000-100,000 years or so).

Another thing is the natural release of CO2 from pockets in the ice, or from volcanic eruptions that release millions of tons of CO2 into the atmosphere in a matter of hours or days.

I would like to reiterate that I think we should be doing everything we can to stop the destructive pollution of our planet. I just think we need to be looking at the bigger picture of climate change as a whole to fully understand the problem we are facing.",1,"How do we know Earth's orbital patterns are not effecting climate change more than humans?

i’m mad about this crappy climate change organization / thoughts on approaching the climate change discussion,"sorry in advance, i really needed to rant.

Today i went to an interview with this organization (rather not name it) that basically advertises itself as on the forefront of fighting climate change, etc. it was advertised as a summer job for students. so first red flag, the job is fundraising, going from house to house to get money. i would get to keep about half. feels a little dirty to me. that is the whole job. talking to people about climate change and asking for money, and then keeping half. oh also if i don’t hit a certain quota per day they don’t have to pay me. so i’m basically working off commission. okay, i’m thinking, this organization needs money to see change happen, i guess i’ll just do my best in the interview and see what happens. 

so i go to the interview. the questions are very forceful and i don’t feel like the woman respects me very much. she nods her head at certain answers and makes small facial indications that she doesn’t like what i’m saying at other times. one thing really jumps out at me: she asks me what i would say to these people to inform them of how important climate change is. i say “well, we’re all in this together and we all need to act to see change happen for us. everyone is affected by this. we need to make sure we’re making the right personal decisions like switching to electric cars for instance and also the right public decisions such as voting and supporting climate change campaigns.” she immediately says “well this isn’t the people’s fault. it’s the industries and the government” and essentially says it’s not up to us (?????) she didn’t say “oh but that isn’t the focus of this campaign” or “but when you talk to people stick to talking about the public side.” no. she literally said essentially that personal decisions don’t make a difference for climate change. i didn’t really know what to do cause i didn’t want to be rude so i kind of nodded. 

then at the end of the interview she said maybe a full paragraph about how many other candidates there were and how qualified they all were and how i had seen them when i was waiting and how they needed to get people on the team fast and that they were actually hiring that very day and then extended the job offer. i was kind of flustered and she pressured me a lot and so i was just like “yes i accept” and agreed to starting the next day and walked out of there feeling super weird and like i had been almost forced into it against my will.

then i was thinking about how weird the whole thing was and i ended up talking with both my parents and they agreed that it seemed kind of fishy and also because i would be commuting (v expensive) i literally could not afford if i didn’t make the quota one day so i figured it’s not worth it to even try because i would lose so much money just by giving it a shot and i could lose a ton of a money even if i did make the quota for a long time. anyways so i decide to call them and say i changed my mind, i felt bad but i also didn’t feel that bad cause i felt i had kind of been pressured into it with no time to think about it. so i call.

so this is the part that really pissed me off. i call to tell them i’m backing out. he says “why, do you not believe in the cause? is climate change not important to you?” and i said “no, it is, but i don’t think i can afford the commute.” and he says, “well we have people who commute from [place farther away than where i live]. isn’t where you live closer?” and i said “yes but this isn’t the right time for me to do this” and he said “well the point of no return is in 12 years, when is gonna be the right time for you?” and then he kept talking about how much the organization is doing to combat climate change and basically asking me if i didn’t care at all, extremely patronizing questions and i eventually said “i respect what you guys are doing but i can’t take the job right now.” 

i hung up from that phone call so angry. i’m so angry right now. i can’t believe this supposedly reputable organization would use tactics like that to keep me in. i’m so glad i got out when i did because they probably would have been just as manipulative if i actually worked with them.

okay, so first of all, how could that woman, the freaking director of this program, possibly say that personal actions have nothing to do with it??? is that just how she sleeps at night? like i don’t understand. how could someone who’s supposed to care about this issue actually say that? it freaking astounds me that that person exists, that people like that could exist. it is everyone that is responsible for climate change. individuals, governments, industry, infrastructure. most parts of the developed world have been built off the backs of fossil fuels. you can’t just turn only corporations into the enemy, or only demand change from the government and that’s it. that is such a freaking victim mentality, such a disempowered position to put yourself in. why would anyone do that expect to feel okay about not trying in their personal life?? i watched a video from hank green (vlogbrothers, i think it was called what game of thrones is really about) talking about how we have ALL benefitted from fossil fuel use. modern society exists today because of fossil fuel use. it’s not about demonizing a certain sect of humanity. it’s about actually moving towards a cleaner and brighter future where we can ALL coexist. demonizing certain people or peoples is not sustainable (no pun intended.) it is only a way to feel better about ourselves. and this is ultimately extremely selfish. we HAVE to take personal responsibility. it is the only way. we have to be humble enough to realize that we are part of the problem too. 

second of all, why would they fucking try to guilt me into staying? what a dumb way to get campaigners. at this point i almost feel like it’s some sort of scam, except that it was with this pretty reputable organization and i’m so angry that they would treat me like that. what i’m most angry about is that it worked. it made me feel like a shitty person. not because i am or think i am but because that’s how he was treating me. this CANNOT be part of the climate change campaign. when we weaponize morality like this, when we say you’re bad for not caring about this. it turns people off. no one is going to listen to you if you’re patronizing in that way. no one is going to listen to someone that talks down to them. person to person respect is the most important part of moving such a huge campaign like this along. WHY would we try to manipulate people? this problem is so real, we have to let the truth speak for itself. trying to manipulate people literally undermines the truth and gravity of the situation. it makes it underhanded instead of honorable to talk about this. we have to find a way to reach people about this without saying they’re bad for not caring about it in the past. i want to make it clear: if you didn’t know or care about climate change before, there should be no judgment on you. by the same token you’re not a “good” person for caring about it. it’s going to kill us. stop trying to pretend your survival instincts make you a saint. (no offense. like we need people who care about it, of course, and like i said i think there is an honor in it. it just pisses me off when people act like they’re above other people for caring about it.) can we stop putting people into categories of good and bad??? this issue is too important for anyone to put their ego into it. it’s not about me or you or anyone else. it’s about how we’re aLL GOING TO DIE! we need to give this issue the respect it deserves. it doesn’t need manipulation. our voices need to be a medium to spread the message, not a way to make us feel self righteous. 

if you’ve made it this far, damn, and thanks. i don’t usually post rants like this but i don’t think i could have let this stupid situation go without getting it out of my system. do you have any thoughts?",1,"i’m mad about this crappy climate change organization / thoughts on approaching the climate change discussion sorry in advance, i really needed to rant.

help choosing between the outdated AR4 Scenarios,"  

Dear climate change community, 

I have a bit of an academic situation and I wanted to know your opinion regarding the subject.  I am a PhD Student, I am doing my PhD in Sustainable Environmental  Architectural Design in the tropics. Anyhow, the thing is I am using this software called Meteonorm  ( [https://meteonorm.com/en/](https://meteonorm.com/en/) ) to generate a series of weather files to generate a territorial climate zoning using the Koeppen method but changing the years of the climate normals, first from 1981 to 1990, then 1991 to 2012 and then a prediction for 2060. My problem is, even though the software is a recent updated version, the thing still uses the AR4 IPCCs scenarios from 2007, thus in order to generate the future files, one must choose between the scenarios B1, A1B and A2. 

At the beginning I had no doubt in using the A2 Scenario, since the last year IPCC special report of Global warming of 1.5°C was a bit alarming and I thought the temperature ranges (2.0 to 5.4 °C) seem to fit on the 100 year predictions, but then I read a paper from 2015 ([https://www.nature.com/articles/srep09957](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep09957) )  which I understood that the most likely scenario was A1B and it made sense, but some years have gone by and thins have evolved a lot in the last years, I understand the AR4 is a bit outdated and the latest reports offer a better and more detailed prediction of what we may encounter but, what would be your recommendation regarding the subject, do you thing conditions may have changed and the A2 is more likely than the A1B? or the A1B still fit the range of possibilities?

I'm torn between being hopeful and being depressed....,"Does anyone else feel this way?

Most of the time I feel crushing anxiety and depression, and I live in a near-constant state of worry. I am afraid for the world we're leaving for our children, and I am so sad about the effects that global heating has already had on other countries (especially on the most vulnerable). I don't think people are doing enough, and I am pessimistic about our chances to combat imminent threat.

But....

Then, sometimes I try to focus on the positives: the amazing work being done to clean up our planet, the steps we are taking in the right direction, and the fact that IF we can stave off complete annihilation we will have made a world that I actually will want to live in. A world that isnt as greedy, or destructive, or hopeless... a world that puts the earth first, instead of our own selfish species.

I tend to oscillate between the two viewpoints lately, and I'm wondering if anyone else feels the same way?

How's our future TRULY looking?,"Recently I've been seeing sources and threads talking about how the likely warming is increasing as models further develop.
Admittedly, I'm not exceptionally knowledgeable on the subject of climate change (at least compared to many others on this subreddit), and I won't pretend I am.

I'm scared something will happen to them, and it kills me that I can't do anything to protect them from something like this.
I suppose what I'm really trying to ask is if there's any plausible reason why we should have hope for the future when our leaders seldom take action and instead make mere proposals. News keeps getting worse and worse, and I don't know how I should respond. What's going to happen to the U.S.? To other regions? What is currently being done that significantly counters the affects of climate change? Realistically, can we stabilize the situation anytime soon, or will I be dead before that happens? I keep seeing others say ""there's always hope for the future,"" but things appear very grim, and what little hope I had is quickly fading.

Sorry if I seem like I'm rambling and asking silly questions. It's late, and I'm tired but very anxious and unable to sleep. I am also sorry if I have depressed anyone else with my ramblings. I am just genuinely scared for my family.

Anyway, I've already taken a quick look at Jack Kelly's site ( [http://jack-kelly.com/about/](http://jack-kelly.com/about/) ) and read a little about his Open Climate Fix research lab. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm gonna go search some more but if anyone could link me to a thread or give me a lead, that would be really helpful.

&amp;#x200B;

Btw, is there a megathread or subreddit for these kinds of questions?"

Best ways to act as a person under 18?,"I think this post can benefit anyone. 

I’m very worried about climate change, and I’m looking for good ways to help move and act, however, I’m restricted due to my age. 

I’m not in control of things like cars and stuff, I’m less in control of my diet (groceries and stuff), it’s tough I attend protests since I would need my family to drive me, and other stuff like that. 

Some things I’m already doing: 
- Public transport toschool (bus and train) 
- Composting (not sure the effect on this, but figured I’d add it here anyways)
- Recycling
- Spreading Information (I wrote this long e-mail to my grandfather about what I thought about the situation and he ended up sharing it to all his friends, and I’ve also spoken about it to my family) 

So yeah... please let me know some things that might help.",1,"Best ways to act as a person under 18? I think this post can benefit anyone.

How exactly is climate change an existential threat?,"I'm fully prepared for people to roast me for even asking, but I'm trying to be thoughtful about this issue...


I'm all for being prepared for, or better yet, trying to prevent any doomsday scenarios, but I really haven't come to terms with what the doomsday scenario for climate change is.

I could imagine a worst case scenario that in maybe 100-1,000 years climate change has gotten so bad that islands become absorbed by the ocean, or that coastal cities are flooded and the landscape of the world as we know it is forever changed. 

If this scenario occurred I would imagine that potentially millions of people would die or be misplaced, which would be a massive tragedy, but even then, I can't imagine how it would be an existential threat to humanity.

I would assume that humans would adapt and find somewhere on the planet to survive and continue to advance humanity.. Would we not?

To me, that seems like the worst case scenario, which would not be a threat to the existence of our planet or human race, and is still a rather far-off or maybe even far-fetched scenario.

I'm not denying that climate change is real or that it may have massive consequences, but when people describe it as an existential threat, it makes me think that I'm either misunderstanding something or that it's being massively overhyped.",1,"How exactly is climate change an existential threat?

Fear,"Climate Change is something that terrifies me unlike anything that I’ve feared before. When I was younger I feared the dark, slept with a nightlight...it was a blue light. I felt so grown up when I finally was able to turn it off and sleep in the dark. Then I was scared of thunderstorms and how loud they were. I felt so grown up when I could not only see they were harmless (to me being inside a house and all) but that I could fall asleep to them at night. Then I was scared of spiders. One jumped on my shirt and stared at my right in the eyes. They were alien to me. Again, I felt so grown up when I realized they only wanted bugs, not people. And again I could finally feel grown up when I could catch a spider and let it outside without any fear. Then I was afraid of nuclear war. (Quite the jump I know) I kept seeing news about Russia and North Korea that had me frightened about the possibility. I had dreams of mushroom clouds and my family screaming. I will never not be afraid of that. Sometimes when things get too quiet, I get a bit anxious as if I’m expecting a nuke to go off. I don’t think I’ll never not fear that. Then came climate change. Always knew it was happening, never denied it. The IPCC report in October had me on edge but I believed we could do it. I took an ecology class, learned how we could kill the Earth 6 ways from Sunday. I had a couple panic attacks every week for about a month. I feared for my family once again. But it was a different fear because when I looked outside all I was were the trees starting to bloom, the grass swaying in the wind. Everything seemed fine. I guess it was my first taste of what you would call Mortal Fear. The trouble I’m having with this fear is the justification. Its not like a Nuke, its not sudden or a single event. We’ve been harming the Earth for over 200 years and she can only do the same to us in return. Whenever I read about the effects I try to tell myself it won’t be a wave of heat that will turn everything into desert: its a slower, gradual process. And I think thats why my fear is worse than before. Because I’m seeing the beauty that is today and what we will loose should we do nothing. Then I read about the recent happenings in the arctic. Still cant think about it for more than a minute without panicking. Not used to it yet.

Can any of you comment on this post? It has me seriously unnerved,"https://freepress.org/article/our-house-fire-it’s-worse

The original Facebook post (which I can’t access) has been making the rounds on Facebook but I’ve also seen it linked several times on reddit.

The whole post is full of terrifying stuff but the overall message is that several factors are coming together to mean we only have a couple of decades before global food shortages bring the whole of society down.

Can any of you comment on the more alarming parts of the post - the IPCC estimates being wildly optimistic being the most important?

I’m already making some pretty serious changes in my life and I’m looking to become part of political movements to put pressure on leaders, but I can’t help the feeling that it’s all for nothing. The kind of drastic changes to society he is proposing simply will not happen given human nature, if incremental progress on this is dooming us then that is a terrifying prospect.

Climate is a self-regulating system,"No one doubts that the level of carbon dioxide has increased since the 19th century or that this leads to increased global average temperature, measurements and observations in ice and sea sediments show this. But measurements also show that there are natural fluctuations of more than 100 ppm and that nature and the atmosphere is a self-regulating system. The ice sheet builds up at Ice Age and when the temperature rises, the melting ice cools down the increasingly heated seas and works a bit like a thermostat in an ordinary car. Ocean currents change the direction because of temperature changes and if the North Atlantic Current of the Gulf Stream were to end, there would be several degrees colder in the Nordic and British islands, which would counteract the melting of the Arctic ice.

Increased temperature in the oceans leads to stronger low pressure with increased cloudiness and stronger winds. The cloud formation shields the earth from the sun radiation, which inhibits the warming. And the winds bring up dust in the atmosphere, which also filters away energy from inhalation. Along with smoke from the increased number of forest fires from areas with prolonged drought.

There are many self-regulating mechanisms like these. But the deeper and more extensive low pressures will also lead to destruction and flooding. While forests and settlements will be burned down in the hinterland and in high-altitude terrain, floods on rivers and coasts will drowning crops and settlements and destroy drinking water resources. And then the darkness comes. The clouds and dust shield of the earth may after a long cooling process end up with a new Ice Age. Which would be needed as the ice since the mid of the 19th century has melted at an ever increasing rate. And inland ice is not only temperature regulating but a vital freshwater resource.

The current level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere corresponds to a global temperature rise of about 15 degrees Celsius. But this will not mean that we will avoid cold winters and get tropical summers with warm, comfortable nights. Rather, on the contrary, the energy supplement would largely consist of different forms of destructive kinetic energy. In the end, the temperatures will fall and the winds will slow down and eventually the shielding cloud and dust layers will dissolve and the sunshine will once again reach the earth's surface. And a new, more stable climate era starts with new ice resources.

Is a focus on carbon emissions an oversimplification?,"To start with, I'll just let you guys know I'm writing from the perspective of the UK, so my experience of climate change discourse is very much based on discussions happening here. 

Now to my question. This morning I was listening to the radio and the news bulletin said government advisors were claiming we need to switch entirely to electric cars by 2030. The bulletin ended, however, by saying that it was uncertain whether or not enough cobalt could be mined to achieve this goal. 

I've been thinking about this a lot recently. Climate change discourse (in the UK at least) seems very much focused on carbon emissions and getting carbon neutral, to the extent that technological solutions still seem to be the norm in this discourse. I'm talking electric cars, wind turbines, solar panels, etc. Although I advocate all of these methods of renewable energy, are we just going to be swapping one crisis for another? 

I'll explain further. What I mean is, if the UK was to switch to electric cars by 2030, would the intensive mining of cobalt in other countries (I assume you can't mine cobalt in the UK) mean we'll simply be promoting the emission of carbon elsewhere? So even though the UK will be able to say it's carbon neutral (in terms of transport at least), it will basically have offset that by causing more emissions elsewhere.

By swapping the crisis I also mean we'll be swapping a greenhouse gases crisis for a resource crisis. Surely the mining of all these resources will have a huge impact on the landscape and habitats. Furthermore, resources aren't unlimited. 

So my question, essentially, is: is focusing only on carbon emissions and getting carbon neutral an oversimplification of the issue in an attempt to make it easier to sell and understand? Don't get me wrong, I 100% back reducing carbon emissions and going carbon neutral, but I can't help but feel the consequences of this process haven't been considered fully. It seems that, as with the majority of the climate change debate, the vastness of this crisis isn't fully being comprehended and instead simple and quick fixes are being attempted. 

Totally willing to have my mind changed though! In fact, I'd rather someone did change it because my view is a bit depressing/complicated/it makes my brain hurt.",1,"Is a focus on carbon emissions an oversimplification? To start with, I'll just let you guys know I'm writing from the perspective of the UK, so my experience of climate change discourse is very much based on discussions happening here. 

Now to my question. This morning I was listening to the radio and the news bulletin said government advisors were claiming we need to switch entirely to electric cars by 2030. The bulletin ended, however, by saying that it was uncertain whether or not enough cobalt could be mined to achieve this goal. 

I've been thinking about this a lot recently. Climate change discourse (in the UK at least) seems very much focused on carbon emissions and getting carbon neutral, to the extent that technological solutions still seem to be the norm in this discourse. I'm talking electric cars, wind turbines, solar panels, etc. Although I advocate all of these methods of renewable energy, are we just going to be swapping one crisis for another? 

I'll explain further. What I mean is, if the UK was to switch to electric cars by 2030, would the intensive mining of cobalt in other countries (I assume you can't mine cobalt in the UK) mean we'll simply be promoting the emission of carbon elsewhere? So even though the UK will be able to say it's carbon neutral (in terms of transport at least), it will basically have offset that by causing more emissions elsewhere.

By swapping the crisis I also mean we'll be swapping a greenhouse gases crisis for a resource crisis. Surely the mining of all these resources will have a huge impact on the landscape and habitats. Furthermore, resources aren't unlimited. 

So my question, essentially, is: is focusing only on carbon emissions and getting carbon neutral an oversimplification of the issue in an attempt to make it easier to sell and understand? Don't get me wrong, I 100% back reducing carbon emissions and going carbon neutral, but I can't help but feel the consequences of this process haven't been considered fully.

When will the world end due to the effect of global climate change?,"As we all know, climate change is affecting our Earth tremendously, mostly because of humans, but also a bit naturally. Anyway, I’ve seen many articles saying that world will end if we don’t change something about our habits of using things that emit greenhouse gases. This scares me, but the thing is, I don’t fully buy it. Every story is different.

One article said that the world will end in 20 years. Another said 50. AOC said 12. A different article says it’s bogus. What should I believe? I need a reliable article to use and you guys are the people who I would expect to know.

What are your guys’ thoughts on this. IMO, I’ve heard the “world will end because of climate change” thing before and people have been saying it for a long time, and if those claims were true, the world would’ve ended a couple years ago.

These claims seem more urgent, however. Idrk. I just need your guy’s help on a helpful source for this.",1,"When will the world end due to the effect of global climate change?

Electric Arc carbon sequestration via renewable sorces?

I imagine that this could be hooked up to wind turbines and other renewables to create carbon capture stations. I wonder how large something like this could be scaled up. Carbon separation from CO2 is much more effective under exposure to UV light so I'd be curious to know if the chamber which contains the  electrical arc could be exposed to sunlight somehow (bubble of transparent material that doesn't impede UV, possibly glass?) if carbon sequestration yield could be increased? (https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2003/03/030320073502.htm)

The thing about electricity is that even after arcing, it still exists and needs to ground. In theory this system could simply be a relay on a path to utilization of the same electricity for consumer purposes.

Climate change - is it actually miles worse than the media make it out to be?,"A number of the things I don't see mentioned in news reports about climate change are,

\- Growing Population, that lives longer. (People at elderly age have now seen our world population ***TRIPLE in their life times) and we're set for more.***

\- The actual impact of rising sea levels and loss of land due to this and urbanisation / soil erosion.

\- The declining availability of ground water in MANY regions across the world which those people totally depend on.

\- (Plus many other countless factors - changes or collapses of delicate ecosystems has knock on effects)

Seems to me it's all coming closer to one very extreme crisis, the balance that humanity has with it's sustainability on this planet is getting more and more unstable, and I believe ultimately the inaction of our elite/governments bring us evermore closer to tipping the scales.

EPA residential Greenhouse Gas Calculator,"I live in Southern Indiana and was researching the EPA residential Greenhouse Gas Calculator.   Here's a link: [https://www3.epa.gov/carbon-footprint-calculator/](https://www3.epa.gov/carbon-footprint-calculator/).

Innovation against climatechange,"Hey Guys,

I\`ve got a question to all of you. 

I mean, I always thought this was kind of clear. But while watching and listening to movements like 'Fridays for Future' im wondering if some people even think about other ways than forcing humanity to stop emiting any climatechange supporting gases.

Wouldn't it be much more efficient and usefull to do research on methods with the goal of converting global warming gases into usable substances, instead of just trying to reduce the emissions?

So, would you agree? And if yes, what scientific methods are already out there that could be usefull (Disregarding the fact that they might not be fully efficient and capable of converting enough gases in the right amount of time to have any kind of impact yet.) ?",1,"Innovation against climatechange Hey Guys,

Am I wrong in seeing potential beneficial consequences in regards to engineering coming from climate change ?,"Since I've been mathematically-informed enough to understand how meteorological models work ( on a high level, at least) and read the interpretations of the data that point towards increasing CO2 in the oceans/atmosphere, increasing temperatures and decreasing CO2 removal from said mediums... I've believed climate change is overall a bad thing.

&amp;#x200B;

Sure, some places might fare better, but overall the new weather will (and to some extent already is) be more chaotic and hard to deal with.

&amp;#x200B;

However, generally speaking, humans have been fairly good at dealing with extreme weather events, and that was dozens of thousands of years ago. Arguably, most of our works of engineering boil down to protecting ourselves from the environment, and we have a huge library of know how doing that... which isn't being utilized to it's full potential right now. 

&amp;#x200B;

That is to say, if your aim is fame and fortune (either in cash or in nr of citations), your best bet in the current economic climate is hardly going to be weather resistant crops, material science focused on wind/rain/snow/heat resistant fabrics, efficient agriculture, Terraforming, tunneling ... etc (i.e important in dealing with the consequences of climate change).

&amp;#x200B;

So, assuming that emissions do cause huge irreversible damage to our climate in the next 20 years (as in, the kind that threatens to disrupt people's lives to the extent that they'd be willing to put their capital behind stopping it), those fields of engineering would surely flourish.

&amp;#x200B;

And, in the long run, two of humanities most pressing problem at the moment are:

&amp;#x200B;

* Building habitable environments on nearby celestial bodies other than earth
* Changing the weather patterns in sub-Sharan Africa in such a way as to make Agriculture (which requires predictive weather patterns) easy, thus hopefully ending most of the death and suffering in that part of the world.

Only issue being... neither of those are being pursued by many driven people at the moment, due to the aforementioned lacking of our economic climate. Nor would they be, if climate change ramped up, but the technologies required would advance pretty quickly.

So, would I be wrong in adopting a view that climate change might actually help press humanity into more actively investing into niches that will be useful to us in the next hundreds of years, rather than wasting away our brightest on menial problems (e.g. trading, ads, insurance... etc) ? 

The one element that I feel is missing around the discussion about consequence is the actual opportunity extreme climate change might bring for restructuring our global economy into something with somewhat more interesting aims. Not to mention, it would surely make some fairly smart put complacent people jump into action to help, since many people are somewhat lethargic unless they are dealing with a real threat.

The best equivalent I can give for this, is how large wars usually manage to actually give us dozens of years of technological progress compressed in 5-7 years of join collaborative applied research.

Declines in wakame and kombu seaweed harvests in Japan this season due to higher ocean temperatures and recent typhoons,"Below is my English transcription of the Youtube video and news article:

Seaweeds such as wakame and kombu, common on our dinner tables, are suffering poor harvests these days. In an average year, it would be wakame season right now. When we interviewed in the production region, the situation was serious.

Atami in Shizuoka Prefecture is known as a hot spring resort town. It is said that wakame from here is soft and tastes good. Announcer Maya Kino also helped a little for this year's first natural wakame harvesting trip. The wakame was unusually small this year. In fact, harvesting restrictions were lifted at the end of last month, but because of their small size, the start of the harvesting season was delayed until the 9th. In even more serious shape was the farmed wakame that was harvested during the winter - just one fifth of a normal year's harvest. The impact of all this in Atami is serious. In Atami, the ""Wakame Festival"" is held every year, where you can have all-you-can-eat fresh wakame, wakame miso soup and wakame salad. Since wakame has been growing slowly this year, the festival has been delayed by one month. One restaurant that had been serving wakame shabu-shabu in their regular menu decided to serve it in their secret menu instead. Bad seaweed harvests have been occurring not only in Atami but all over Japan as well.

Wakame in Iwate and Miyagi prefectures is well known as ""Sanriku wakame"", but its production level at the end of last month is 30% lower than during the same period last year. The wholesale price is now higher than even during the immediate aftermath of the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami, when it was scarce. Kombu, which is indispensable to tsukudani and dashi, continues to be in a tough spot. About 90% of Japanese kombu are from Hokkaido, and although the prices set by producers' groups depend on various factors, they have been generally rising for the last three years. Furthermore, in Okinawa, early harvest mozuku have not been growing well, and the wholesale value is higher than last year. When we asked multiple producers' groups about what is causing the bad harvests, they pointed out that seaweed cannot move around like fish. In recent years, sea temperatures have risen, and typhoons hit many areas last year. Since the seaweed itself cannot move to avoid typhoons, they can easily get washed away. In other words, the harshening environment afflicting Japan's oceans is said to be the cause of the poor seaweed harvests.

"Where will people logically migrate in Ontario, Canada due to climate change?","I am gathering information for a fictional story where the characters will need to relocate due to climate change.

Story setting: Ontario, Canada, but other provinces may be involved.

From my current research, it appears more people would move from the West (due to wildfires) to the East (lower temperatures). However, the Great Lakes appear to be heating up faster than the rest of the US. This will be more extreme weather to the Southern Ontario region. There has already been increased flooding in Ontario over the past few years.

My question is, what would be the most logical place for people to migrate? Would people in Southern Ontario migrate northeast to avoid flooding, or would people in the North be more inclined to migrate South?

I've tried looking up flooding areas and topographical maps, but my research has fallen short.

While I fully understand in reality this would most likely be a slow migration over a number of years, I intend to use artistic license to speed up the process and increase the stakes. My main concern is to get the facts correct and try to accurately predict where the characters would most likely need to go.

What might things be like after carbon drawdown?,"Sorry if this has already been asked or if this ain’t the right place to ask or whatnot...

I’d better preface this by saying I know there’s not an overwhelming amount of hope and I’m personally not very optimistic. But we hear a lot about what kind of weather events and other repurcussions we’ll see more of with x degrees, so I was wondering what kind of world we could expect if global coordinated efforts did switch to green energy and invest in heavy use of carbon capture technology and ultimately reduce atmospheric carbon to safe levels. How long would extreme weather carry on? Would there be a mini ice age? Would the sudden loss of carbon from the air do anything weird? Sorry to sound dumb but I’m not a scientist or a meteorologist or anything like that. I’d be interested to know if anyone has seen any theories about this. I don’t suppose things will just “go back to normal” but it’d be cool to get an idea.",1,"What might things be like after carbon drawdown?

Chandler wobble effects on climate,"So for those not familiar, the Chandler wobble is a name for the perturbation in the nutation of the Earth about its principal axis. This is a generally well-understood phenomena, however, there have been recent variations in the Chandler wobble of the Earth,  more recently with a 180 degree phase shift in 2005. I have posted here before asking for any knowledgeable person(s) to please cite any references to astronomical effects that could be a source of climate change. According to Gross et al, ""Some scientists predict the last wobble to have happened nearly 4000 to 7500  years ago during a time when there were dramatic changes in the pattern of monsoons across northern Africa. The researchers claim that it has  transformed the Great Saharan Desert into somewhat greener territory.""

Is anyone here familiar with these effects? The fact that they are still very much a topic of investigation and an open area of research, could this not be changing the atmosphere in a significant way?

Climate Scepticism Unpacked - Help!,"Dear Reddit,

There is a figure out there, that I read in an article. It is that human emissions of GHGs is only 4%. The text did not clarify if this was annual or not. I asked my professors (I am in college) about this fact, and many were not sure about this statistic - arguing that although it may be true, tipping points in systems is the main concern of climate scientists. That is that a small shift in GHG emissions can possibly trigger large unpredictable positive feedbacks that my lead to much greater and greater GHG emissions.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone know the exact science to unpack this statistic and does anyone know the theorized thresholds of GHG emissions that scientists believe may cause a tipping point?

I took the CO2 numbers for March 2018 and March 2019 from [CO2.earth](https://CO2.earth) (Mauna Loa Observatory), and made extrapolations to 2100 with linear (steady absolute value increase) and geometric (same % of growth every year).

The numbers are respectively 633 and 704 ppm CO2, which means the path we're on is a little over RCP 4,5.

"Questions, What-ifs, And what is policy?","Global Warming.

At some point the icecaps will melt, the oceans will acidify, and the spreading desert will claim all of the eco-systems on earth. To this effect many recent debates have centered on the idea of Carbon Sequestration, removing ton after ton of carbon dioxide from our atmosphere; essentially undoing the damage done.

A recent article caught my eye. At 415 PPM Co2, these levels have not been seen for ~3 million years. But at that point in time there was, in fact, a natural amount of that element in the air.

So in out what-if scenario, if instead we were talking about ""Global Cooling"" - impending ice ages, ocean icecube events, catastrophic glacial formations destroying every eco-system on earth.... What would the policy be?

And the question; aside from anthropological generation, the effects of which are turning out to be quite impactful, if the natural swing of Earth's  climate were to trend toward and unstable or unlivable balance, is it truly appropriate for Humanity to be engaging in geo-engineering?

If we go too far in sequestering Co2 and potentially other greenhouse gasses at what point would it be decided ""alright this is stable. we are good with these conditions.""?

What I'm doing to reduce my carbon footprint.,"Hello all!

It's difficult to stay positive sometimes and wonder what us individuals can do to fight climate change, so I wanted to outline what I'm personally doing to reduce my carbon footprint. I've altered aspects of my life in the past year, and while on a large scale it isn't much, it makes me proud of what it is that I can control.

&amp;#x200B;

**ELECTRICITY**

* Starting April 1st, I will get 100% of my home electricity from renewable resources. I pay extra for this through my energy provider in California, and don't mind how it will marginally increase the cost of my bill compared to the 40% renewables on the grid (in SF). I'm from BC, Canada which is 97% renewable, and wanted to get back to that.
* Using smart home tech I have significantly reduced my energy usage through automation. Lights, fans, and other devices now auto-power off if I'm not in the room or leave my apartment. My energy bill is now just \~$25 per month down from around $38 (34.2% decrease).

&amp;#x200B;

**SOLAR**

* Prior to having the option to acquire 100% renewables for my energy bill, I experimented with solar panels.
* I capture and store, through a 21W solar panel in my apartment window, enough energy to power my phone, headphones, and other wireless devices each day. The setup was simple, and it's a nice thought each day that your phone is effectively solar-powered.

&amp;#x200B;

**GAS**

* After moving to SF I realized the heating in my place is primarily gas. Coming from Canada, I decided I would not need heating (or could warm up in other ways) and had my gas shut-off about 8 months ago. This saves about $15/mo alone on the pilot light, and reduces the constant burn of natural gas.
* For the past 6 years I have rarely used my car, only driving about 1-3 times per month. A year ago I put my car in storage and save about $200/mo on insurance. I walk to work, grocery store, or wherever I want and don't drive. If needed, I take an Uber maybe 1-2 times per month on a short trip and otherwise use local transit (electric).

&amp;#x200B;

**FOOD**

* I've rarely eaten red meat for the last 10 years anyway (due to preference), so I primarily consume chicken or soy-based proteins.
* I'm not overweight, and am very good at estimating my calorie consumption to avoid any food waste.
* A portion of my nutrients (typically breakfast) comes from Soylent (powder) and is more sustainable with less waste.
* I purposefully avoid eating at restaurants or establishments that have higher food portions (which I cannot finish) regardless if I like the food. Otherwise, see if I can split it into two meals.

&amp;#x200B;

**PLASTIC**

* As a consumer, given the choice I will purchase a product in more sustainable packaging even if it's a higher cost. I look for paper, glass, or recycled components in the packaging when possible. This doesn't take much time at all.
* Every piece of plastic I do consume I properly recycle, and when necessary ensure it's been cleaned without residue so it can be recycled.
* Plastic bags are avoided. I will carry items, use reuseable or paper-based bags instead. This is fairly easy as they are banned in SF in many cases.
* I avoid plastic lids + straws with drinks. Most of the time I only order water anyways, but will opt-out of these.
* If getting an item to-go, I will hand back any plastic utensils or other items not needed.

&amp;#x200B;

**AS A CONSUMER**

* I try to live a more minimalistic lifestyle, and aren't a big fan of 'trinkets' or useless items. I only buy what I need, and what I know I will use. I'm not an impulse-buyer, and don't end up with a lot of junk to begin with. 
* I resell or donate any items I can that I do not need. I will avoid throwing anything out if someone else can use it.
* In my job I promote less waste and make decisions that support this. In Marketing, traditionally there can be a lot of waste whether paper or useless promotional items, and I steer the team and company away from this.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I'm doing a lot already, but also that I'm just getting started. I'm working on possibly carbon-offsetting any remaining emissions I produce, and also investing in primarily green companies that are fighting against climate change.

Trajectory toward Blue Ocean Event (Arctic sea ice minimum &lt; 1 km3),"The best current estimates are that this will occur between 2030-2050.

Here's the trend line of Arctic Sea Ice Volume over the last 40 years. We are clearly in a phase of steady decline with year to year variability due to weather. Sea ice minimum has steadily declined from 17M km3 to 5M km3 during that interval.

[http://psc.apl.uw.edu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/schweiger/ice\_volume/BPIOMASIceVolumeAprSepCurrent.png](http://psc.apl.uw.edu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/schweiger/ice_volume/BPIOMASIceVolumeAprSepCurrent.png)

&amp;#x200B;

A Blue Ocean event is more than just symbolic. A lot of energy is necessary to convert ice from solid to liquid state. When the ice is gone, all of that energy will be used to heat the ocean. In addition, the lost albedo (we've already lost a lot) will alsomean greater heat absorption. This represents a significant phase change in the earth's climate system.

&amp;#x200B;

If you examine the trend line in the graph, the case for a Blue Ocean event in the suggested time line is pretty evident. Deniers will point to extremists like MacPherson making past predictions of accelerated demise of Arctic ice as a means of detracting from mainstream science projections. They're making a spurious argument.

In addition, the lost albedo (we've already lost a lot) will alsomean greater heat absorption. This represents a significant phase change in the earth's climate system.

&amp;#x200B;

If you examine the trend line in the graph, the case for a Blue Ocean event in the suggested time line is pretty evident. Deniers will point to extremists like MacPherson making past predictions of accelerated demise of Arctic ice as a means of detracting from mainstream science projections. They're making a spurious argument.

Bison and climate change,"I recall seeing this some years ago but forgot about it until it was re-posted on FB recently:

I thought I'd put a post here for anyone else that runs into it.

The numbers in the meme all come from a single [2010 paper by Kelliher and Clark](https://sci-hub.tw/10.1016/j.agrformet.2009.11.019?fbclid=IwAR2_4hFedXzw4uetyFO12EQDHdpC0HFzattxD7YmDOSTuDj3Z76-dL_QzK8). The meme, however, grossly misrepresents the paper.

First, the meme starts by claiming that there were ""60 million buffalo"" in the US. However, this number appears specifically so the authors can dismiss it because ""The population estimate was proposed without explanation"", and then go on to state that ""bison herd population estimates from the popular literature as greatly overstated"". Then then explain why they choose 30M, half the figure stated in the meme.

Then the meme claims there are ""9.4 million dairy and 31.7 million beef cows in America"". That number also  appears in the original paper. However, it is preceded by the important statement that it includes only the cattle ""in the 10 American states occupying the bison’s historic range"". This is not the number of cattle in the US, it's the number of cattle in the great plains. If one simply googles ""number of cattle in the usa"" you'll find the total is actually around 95 million.

They make the rhetorical argument that one has to ""...prove cow fats are more destructive the the environment..."". Of course the paper also demonstrates this as well, calculating that the average modern cow releases 19% more CH4 than historical bison. The meme concludes by dismissing the whole thing, but as the paper notes, ""Thus, the Great Plains bison were estimated to have made a significant contribution to enteric CH4 emissions in the pre-industrial world.""

To put this in a global perspective, there are currently about [170 million buffalo in the world](http://www.mjas.ukim.edu.mk/files/MJAS-01-02-_2011_-048-Borghese.pdf), utterly dominated by domestic water buffalo. In contrast, there are [just over 1.4 billon cows](https://www.drovers.com/article/world-cattle-inventory-ranking-countries-fao). So even in the most ridiculous overestimates of bison populations, they remain a drop in the bucket compared to the cattle numbers.

So if anyone else comes across this, point them here.",1,"Bison and climate change I recall seeing this some years ago but forgot about it until it was re-posted on FB recently:

He doesn't believe that I will see the effects of climate change in my lifetime. Every time I brought up research to back what I was saying, simply the fact that humanity needs to change or we are headed for a bad future, he said that it was all just fear-mongering and refused to even look at any statistics, saying that I should just forget about it and try to enjoy my life, when I asked him if he had ever researched it he said he refused to, because anything he does won't change it, where I tried to tell him that it's up to everyone to change it, and he just gets angry and tells me to 'stop reading all that shit' I asked him why he thinks that way, 'I dunno, it's just what I think, it's all bullshit' 

So he thinks it's bullshit, won't look into it at all, and if he's wrong he doesn't care cause he'll be dead. I tried to tell him I'm more scared for my future kids and his grandchildren but he just says, ah well, when we die that's it I guess.

"We will increase focus on developing energy technologies, and we should also recognize the advancement in internal combustion","Bashing on fossil fuels is currently en-vogue. This is understandable, as our extraction, processing, and consumption of fossil fuels leading up to the 1970's and into the 1980's was just obscene.  
  
The EPA was established in 1970 in the US and this was a needed check. Necessary regulations around industrial and consumer pollutant output was becoming recognizably destructive to our environment. Most other nations were slow to follow suit.  
  
Since the establishment of the EPA in the US, there has been very little attention given to the advancements in both extraction and consumption of Earth-bound fuels. This is a shame as many very educated and talented STEM women and men worked so hard to make this happen.   
  
Gas/diesel-powered engines provide more power, and produce less pollutants year-over-year since the EPA was established.  
  
Think that hybrid is so eco-friendly? Guess again. Research in how the minerals for the batteries were produced. Research how many parts had to be shipped, trucked or railroad-transported to the assembly plants.  
  
It is just frustrating to hear how politicians and talking heads constantly claim that we are all going to die soon all while our Earth is greener now and we burn fuel more efficiently,

Please explain your suggestions! It really does help!,"Hear me out before you downvote or comment, okay? I love this subreddit and the community so far. The information that comes through and the good atmosphere that’s open to discussion is great. I’ve been doing some reading on this subreddit again, and of course, many posts are written asking what they can do to support climate change. Great. That’s a good thing. When scrolling through the comments though, while some answers are well written out and explained, some are simply just “plant trees” or “become vegan” (both of which are options I fully support and I’m not implying they’re bad). 

Not seeing the issue yet? Here I go then. 
You can’t just write the option without explaining them, can you? People are asking for help and asking for these options because they don’t know what to do. While this doesn’t mean they are uneducated on the topic of climate change, it could very well mean they are uneducated on the possible solutions to help it. 

I know a lot of people shit on being vegan for some reason (I’m not vegan myself but I do support it), whether it’s because they are meat-lovers or because they just think it’s silly, that’s definitely going to be a roadblock for a lot of people. Depending on the reputations of certain solutions, people will just avoid them due to those reputations. 

So if you’re going to comment that veganism is a good solution, then explain why! Explain the lower carbon-footprints and it’s perks and significance. If you’re going to comment that planting trees are helpful, explain why. The more information, the better educated that person could be/get and the easier it could be to convince them to make that change. 

Let me know. Does this sound wrong or weird? I get that some people don’t have the care or the time to write out a properly written response with sources/Information. I get it, nobody is forcing you to, right? Sometimes it’s better to just not post that comment.

Please let me know if this post is against the rules. If it is, I’ll take it down, but regardless I don’t regret writing it and Im glad I could get my point across.

"A way to combat climate change, if true.","So i’m not a climate change denier, and I won’t discus my political views here, so the title or more or less a formality. 

So let’s say climate change is here, and we need to solve it. The main issues are ocean life and average global temperatures rising, causing disruptive effects in the food chain and possible damage to coastal cities from melting ice caps. 
The rise in CO2 levels are not inherently bad, and typical result in an increase in plat life, growth, and increase in O2. 
So if the CO2 is not inherently an issue, but the temperatures and flooding are, why not use geoengineering to combat these two specific issues? Dissolving copious amount of iron into the ocean typically results in massive phytoplankton growth, and releasing SO2 into the stratosphere reflects more light back out into outer space, cooling the earth. 
This is cheaper than most, if not all, proposed solutions, and could be done in just a couple decades. Time wouldn’t matter as much here, as we are reversing the effects straight away.

Anyone else feel burnt out?,"Here’s some background. I have a bachelors of science in marine and atmosoheric science. I’m now getting my PhD in marine science, which is of course closely linked to climate science (thermohaline circulatuon, the ocean as a carbon sink, etc). In between undergrad and my PhD I worked for NOAA for a year. 

People ask me all the time about my job and my thoughts on climate change. I really don’t mind answering questions from people who are genuinely curious. But I feel like most people who bring up the topic just try to attack everything I say. I explain the science, and somehow it’s still not good enough. What am I supposed to do? Here’s some examples. First, there’s a woman who was on a friends post commenting completely conspiracy-theory based ideas about CO2 and was completely wrong about the chemistry involved at that. I tried to correct it but she just told me all of my science is wrong because Newton’s laws of physics are “outdated.” What? I regularly explain the science and people can’t refute it so they just say “but it’s fake” or “the science isn’t accepted.” Even my own father thinks that climate change is fabricated and scientists are making it up so they have something to study, like we don’t have better things to do. I’m honestly so over it. Any suggestions on how to deal with these kinds of people? 

Edit: I realize now this is similar to previous posts, but I’m not looking for facts on how to “prove” anything. Just advice on how to grow a thicker skin or compartmentalize or something. It’s tiring.",1,"Anyone else feel burnt out? Here’s some background. I have a bachelors of science in marine and atmosoheric science.

What can one person REALLY do?,"But honestly, what can one person really do?  What REAL impact can one single individual make about climate change?

One person making even an extreme change in their lifestyle (such as going from meat-eating to vegan as some suggest) isn't going to make even a minute difference in the big picture. Heck even offing oneself to thus ensure making a no additional carbon footprint in one's future isn't going to make a buy the world a additional millisecond.  Even if the average adult devoted the rest of their lives to fighting climate change (by living the most carbon neutral lifestyle, spending 100% of their spare time planting trees &amp; working with climate change fighting charities) I don't' see where it would make little to no difference.

I truly doubt that a non-average person can make a difference on their own.  Would it even matter if a multi-millionaire spend all of their money buying land &amp; planting trees to offset carbon emissions?  (Seriously, someone do the calculation on this please.)

The only real way to make any effective change is with power &amp; influence.  The bulk of emissions is done by corporations.  So until those stop, climate change will continue.  Industrial emissions would need to be heavily regulated &amp; corporate culture would need to change globally from ""make money first"" to ""go green even if it costs us money &amp; is inconvenient"".  This is highly unlikely to happen, as the world's economy is based on these corporations making money.  Also, even if one major government would regulate its industry, that won't do anything to affect those in other countries (other than to give them an economic advantage).

Technology is the only other answer that I see, but that is dependent in large part on those very industries which need to be regulated.  Also, on having the right person in the right circumstances (i.e., intelligent, educated people funded to do research which probably won't make money) which in large part seems to be luck.

I'm not a climate change expert or economist, or hold any position of power or influence.  I'm just an average person struggling to get by in life (like billions of other people here on this planet), &amp; wishing that I could do something that actually would make a difference.  I'd like to help, but I just don't see anything that I do is going to make any significant difference.  It just seems futile anyway unless those with greater power than me make big changes &amp; I'm not too optimistic about that. So why shouldn't' I just live out the rest of my life the way I've been going &amp; not worry about it?

I am a Freshman in College in Missouri currently studying for a degree in TV and Film. One night while scrolling through Twitter, I stumbled onto discussions about climate change. Just reading about the reality of it all was chilling, to say the least. I always new it was happening but was very ignorant about just how much. I couldn’t look away from it and could barley sleep.

Easiest way to shut down a climate denier?,"Short and simple please, tired of bullshit opinions from people who ignore science",1,"Easiest way to shut down a climate denier? Short and simple please, tired of bullshit opinions from people who ignore science"
Looking for information and feedback," Global warming/climate change:  
1) Is the climate changing more rapidly than we have observed in the past 150 or so years? Seems likely.  
2) Is it caused by human intervention in the environment? It is hard to just say, ""the science"" points to yes, especially knowing first-hand, that there is an extreme amount of bias and subjectivity in drawing conclusions in any scientific study. That is precisely why we do not depend indefinitely on a single source for any cutting edge result. Additionally, there is so much liberal bias in the scientific community, how can one distinguish what is subjective fact and a completely biased interpretation of results (especially when not being an expert yourself)? There is something extremely pretentious and presumptuous in a belief such as this.   
Having said that, could the deforestation and air pollutants created by industrialization of humans be a culprit or contributor? Certainly. Has literally any scientific study thoroughly assessed the possibility this is due to one of many, many astronomical perturbations of Earth's non-nominal rotation, oblateness, not-perfectly-elliptical and variably perturbed orbit, or effects of other celestial objects (ex. the Moon, Jupiter, potentially undiscovered objects in the LaGrange points of the Earth-Sun or Earth Moon systems, etc.)? Some mention astronomical effects very briefly (the most I have found is a single sentence that immediately rules this out as a possibility), but I have a very deep suspicion that they were not very thorough investigations. So as far as I have read, these things have not been addressed, and if you have anything to say otherwise, please share. My goal is to educate myself and make my own judgement call, not to blindly accept some biased researchers' opinion.  
3) Is this a bad thing? Will there be doom and gloom as a result? Many die from cold temperatures every year. As less do, the argument is that more will die from more extreme heat or other effects of climate change. Seems debatable. Nothing I have read has convinced me of deaths from heat alone being a major issue - especially in light of the drastic reduction in cold-related deaths. Will there be ""new normal"" extremes in weather patterns? We cannot even accurately predict the weather. What makes us believe these same models can somehow be more accurate over decades? Many studies are actively debating this exact thing and the jury is still out as far as I can tell. Is this sensationalism to get more research funding? Or sensationalism to get more votes/support from constituencies? Those seems much more likely than the former.  
4) Should the US be the primary entity held responsible for changing it? I strongly believe that it is quite naive and overstates our ability, let alone to even begin to understand how to positively influence a trend in such a complex system as the global environment. I mean, we cannot even predict the weather correctly (See any major snow/storm announcement in Northern Alabama in the last 6 years as an easy, albeit anecdotal example of this).   
Additionally, how can we rule out that this is not just a ploy for self-aggrandizement for the political left? When you have industrializing nations such as China and India with orders of magnitude greater populations pumping the largest amounts of pollution into the air, this seems unreasonable to put on the US's shoulders. I believe we have come quite a long way in the last 30 to 40 years and have a very acceptable amount of environmental protection in place. At some point, you get greatly diminished returns, especially when we are not even close to the primary polluters of the world.  
5) Is this a good thing? Since we will reduce the number of people dying from extreme cold, that certainly is not bad. Will an increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere lead to any other negative effects on the environment at large? The things that I have read here say things like, ""the increase in algae will cause a massive die-off of coral reefs and other sea life"". These are complex systems that DO NOT exist in isolation. When one creature or plant thrives, others sometimes take advantage of this. How do we know that animals that thrive on algae will not proportionally grow to accommodate the new source of sustenance? Can anyone say for certain that would not be the case? My limited biology background gives me the intuition that more carbon dioxide means more fuel for plant growth, which is a good thing, if we want more plants. With all of the deforestation humanity has brought about, wouldn't more lush and plentiful plant-life be a good swing in the right direction? Also, less cold globally means less need for man-made heat, i.e. reduced power needs and therefore less carbon emissions. That is also a good thing.   
Can anyone give me any other points on this or actual scientific research (not just articles written by biased journalists that think they are scientists, etc.)?",1,"Looking for information and feedback  Global warming/climate change:  
1) Is the climate changing more rapidly than we have observed in the past 150 or so years? Seems likely.  
2) Is it caused by human intervention in the environment? It is hard to just say, ""the science"" points to yes, especially knowing first-hand, that there is an extreme amount of bias and subjectivity in drawing conclusions in any scientific study. That is precisely why we do not depend indefinitely on a single source for any cutting edge result. Additionally, there is so much liberal bias in the scientific community, how can one distinguish what is subjective fact and a completely biased interpretation of results (especially when not being an expert yourself)? There is something extremely pretentious and presumptuous in a belief such as this.   
Having said that, could the deforestation and air pollutants created by industrialization of humans be a culprit or contributor? Certainly. Has literally any scientific study thoroughly assessed the possibility this is due to one of many, many astronomical perturbations of Earth's non-nominal rotation, oblateness, not-perfectly-elliptical and variably perturbed orbit, or effects of other celestial objects (ex. the Moon, Jupiter, potentially undiscovered objects in the LaGrange points of the Earth-Sun or Earth Moon systems, etc.)?

Evaluating some NOAA data,"Im looking at some data from the NOAA regarding CO2 levels in Earth's atmosphere during the past recorded from ice cores.

What seems odd is that there is a column for the data titled "" age\_gas\_calBP"" and described ""	age, gas, , calendar years before present ""

This makes sense, there should be a year before present next to each co2 value. But these values range from -50 to 800,000. How could ice core measurements give measurements of a atmosphere in the future? Whats going on here?

A massive string of climate-related disasters have hit my country over the last six months. I have started researching just how dire the climate situation is and am paralysed with dread.,"EDIT: thank you to everyone who has commented. You’ve given me perspective and some useful ideas to take action. I will be careful about over researching/ thinking critically about climate news. I am going to talk to someone about my anxiety.


I live in Australia. In the past six months alone, we have had: 

* more then a million dead fish floating in the Darling River in New South Wales.
* thousands of cattle drowned in flash-flooding in rural Queensland, leaving farmers who were crippled by the drought financially ruined and struggling to bury the bodies of their animals.
* the driest and hottest January in recorded history, 1.5 degrees above the national average. Every summer has been hotter then the last.

This is in Australia, an industrially developed country that’s rich enough to shelter the majority of its citizens from the realities of climate change. I’m just starting  to comprehend how the climate disaster has ravaged other countries.

  
I am so ashamed to admit that it took a catastrophe of these proportions to shake me out of my slumber and realise the apocalypse we’re gunning towards.

  
Over the last week, I have been doing all the research I can, and it’s slowly sinking in...

  
I found out that the biggest thing that you can do to increase your climate footprint is have kids. Having kids is something I’ve always wanted to do. I love kids. I flirt with different careers but I’ve always known I want to be a dad, a grandpa.  But how can I justify having children when adding to the population will only make their situation worse? How can I justify building a career, finding someone to love, having a family, when I can’t even guarantee that my family will survive to have children of their own? I’m grieving for children I haven’t even had yet. (I know there’s always adoption, and I wouldn’t need the kids I raise to be mine biologically, but adoption laws are really strict in Australia.) My friends have a little girl and I love her more then anything. What will her future be like? Will she have a future?

  
I want to run around screaming at everybody, “Wake up! Wake up! We can’t do this anymore! We need to stop this NOW!” I’m trying to tell my parents that we need to turn fans off, and  turn powerpoints off at the wall, and stop eating so much meat, and wasting food. I’m trying to tell them how scared I am and they tell me I’ve overreacting. I’m having anxiety attacks at work. I’m trying to work my way through existential dread on my lunchbreaks. I see my friends laughing and smiling and I try and joke with them, and sometimes I even forget for a little bit. I don’t want to tell them what I’m going through. I don’t want them to be scared like I am.

  
 And it’s so horrible because I’ve experienced anxiety before, and I’ve calmed myself down by telling myself the situation that I’m worried about might never come to pass. But I can’t do that. Because the thing I’m terrified of will happen. It’s been happening for years and it’s happening now. I should be scared. Everyone should be scared. I have to take beta blockers just to get through the day. What would happen if everyone came off their anxiety meds at once? Would there be riots in the streets? Would we stop pretending everything was business as usual? Would shit actually happen?

  
Even trying to distract myself just makes the problem worse. I drive the car to work and that puts gasses into the air. I try and play my PS4 to keep my mind off everything but that just uses more electricity and puts more carbon in the air. The computer I’m typing this on consumes electricity, and was probably assembled by a Chinese slave to boot.  I will be moving to a new city in a week’s time and that flight alone will pump a few thousand cubic metres of gasses that shouldn’t be there into the air. And I don’t even fly that much - I know people my age that fly to new countries every few months just to have something new to put on their fucking Instagram. How can I justify being alive? How can I justify all the resources I consume just by existing? How can any of us?  

Our government will not propose a remotely sustainable climate policy. Our current prime minister brings lumps of coal into parliament and shakes them around saying that we shouldn’t be scared of fossil fuels.  Our government ministers go to climate change meetings and make jokes about how rising sea levels will have people in our neighbouring, tiny island nations 'with water lapping at their ankles.’ The last prime minister to propose a carbon tax lost her job because of it. They did this to us. They don’t give a shit. And we did this to ourselves by continuing to vote them in. We do this to ourselves by pulling the wool over our eyes and continuing to live our lives as if nothing is happening when it clearly is. 

  
I’m trying to take action. I’m trying to phase red meat and dairy out of my diet. I don’t want to give in. I want to get my stuff at the farmers market,  catch the train instead of the car, go on marches, make some fucking noise. If we are going out I want to go out fighting hard. I don’t want to be one of the people  who have the power or information to change and didn’t. But is it too late? Are we too far gone to make a difference? If it’s taken this long, and this much to happen to convince me, how much longer will it take to convince the skeptics? Will it be when all the water evaporates, or we can’t even drink it because it’s so acidic? Will it be when none of us can even eat real food anymore, because there’s not enough grass to feed the livestock or water to grow the crops? Will it be when the cars start catching fire in the streets and people can’t go outside in the daytime because it’s too hot? When people start dying in the street from heatstroke? When will they see?

  
I’m not scared of dying but I don’t want to die like this. I don’t want my friends, my family, the people I love to die like this. I don’t want the people who are already dying from this to die like this.   

I don’t want to live in fear. But I’m so scared. ",1,"A massive string of climate-related disasters have hit my country over the last six months.

I miss the debate about pollution.,"When I was a kid, in the eighties, I thought we would be living in a clean world by now, because there was A LOT of talk about pollution. We discussed fossil fuels, garbage in nature and everything else. Every spring at the last day of school, the local credit union gave a feast to ten grades of elementary kids for cleaning up the beach.
Ever since climate change became the label, we’ve been stuck between for and against the science.
What about the evidence? The pollution.
If we clean up, we will know. Either way, it’s the only way. In the meanwhile, we can certainly improve in cutting down on pollution.
There is very little coverage about the ocean clean up project for example.
We totally dismiss all these local beach cleaning projects and continue arguing about who is right about the science, instead of just doing the work.
The green future will happen through innovation, it’s how we are as species, always going for the next awesome thing.

I feel that the endless debate about climate change is slowing us down.
It’s giving some people stress and not the relief we get from a clean environment.
It’s giving some people depression and anxiety, because they fear it’s too late and that we will just go on like a flock of lemmings over a cliff.

So, what are some of the coolest ideas around today, that really tackle this issue and are already happening, but could use some push to scale it up and improve the situation faster?

The end is coming - no matter how fast we try to change...," 

I have accepted that the end is near for us, it's obvious at every corner, culture, art, music, all of it is reflecting a doomed humanity, those three things have ushered in many things as somewhat of a prophecy or a resonance of the emotions/feelings we have as a whole. I live in australia, every day getting scarier than the last with storms and heat. I'm only 25, sometimes I sit outside in the incoming storms and cry, because I can feel the roar of this planets last few breaths before it collapses within itself, I love nature and everything in it, I always have. I HATE humans, we've always turned what we touch into ash, my hopes were always in saving the LIFE on this planet, but we're killing the hopes for that too. insect populations plummeting globally on average of 2.5% per year, and microbes within the oceans soil - some of if not the most resilient life forms on our planet, are dying. We will take everything with us in our demise.

Hate feeling like I have to be a climate expert just to talk about climate change,"This issue arises with family, because I have extremists on both ends. My mother is a staunch denier, while my uncle is an extreme alarmist (like dead in the next 2 years). The problem? They are both constantly googling and memorizing things to bolster their sides, whereas I don't. I am not a climate change expert, nor do I think I need to be to understand that climate change is heavily affected by humans, going to have negative impacts, and needs to be addressed.

My biggest issue is that both of them keep trying to pull me on to their side. Almost every point they make can be refuted it with a couple minutes of googling on my end, but there's no way to have a legit discussion about it when I have to be glued to my phone to talk about the basic facts.

Any advice for what to do? I've tried not bringing it up or changing the topic, but when they directly tell me something as fact I can't just nod my head and blindly agree.

Why I’m skeptical with climate change,"Before everyone goes at me, no I’m not a climate change denier. I believe it is real and most of it is man made. However, some of the predictions on the news I find questionable. Such as the “12 years until we’re doomed” meme going around some climate alarmists. I believe that this is just the minimum time when we can stop warming above 1.5 degrees Celsius, and we have a _little_ more time until things start to get chaotic. This is coming from a soon-to-be 15 year old, and I believe that some of the exaggerated claims and fear mongering in some climate news is incredibly damaging to the mental health of teens and adults. 

No, we’re not going to be cooking alive and the sidewalks start melting like we are on Venus in our lifetimes. Things WILL suck in the near future, but we can survive. It is not completely bleak, like alarmists say. Is it concerning? Absolutely. Will there be an apocalypse in the next couple decades? The world, as we know it, may severely change, and some may feel like it is the end. But it is debatable, and I believe we should attempt to work to help it, but also focus on our own lives. As being all doom and gloom about this can be severely unhealthy.

How to deal with Climate Anxiety,"Having lurked on this thread, and experienced many of the issues that other members have faced i.e. a sense of doom and gloom and helplessness ib this situation, I thought I would offer some advice on how to mentally deal with this scenario.

In an age where continual growth is the aim, where 'smashing our goals', and competing against everyone is all that matters, we've lost a sense of perspective. Life has become ubfeasible.

The truth is, you alone cannot solve the world's problems. Most of us can't even solve the problems of people closest to us, let alone the lives of strangers thousands of miles away. So, let's focus on what we can control. This is where stoic philosophy comes into play.

The stoics believed that there are only two things you can control; everything else is secondary. They are:

1. Your thoughts
2. Your actions

You cannot control how hot the world is going to get. You cannot control the decline of biodiversity. You cannot stop fossil fuels burning. 

What you CAN control, is your behaviour which can ultimately affect the world in a positive way.

Your job, every single day, is to simply focus on being the best citizen you can be. Being environmentally aware. Being positive. Whether you influence those around you or not, is out of your control. So don't worry about it. 

Remember this, and you will feel better about yourself, will worry less about how others will perceive you, and without realising, your actions will have impact.",1,"How to deal with Climate Anxiety Having lurked on this thread, and experienced many of the issues that other members have faced i.e. a sense of doom and gloom and helplessness ib this situation, I thought I would offer some advice on how to mentally deal with this scenario.

Can reforestation absorb enough CO2 to save us?,"Hello! 

I have a question, and I was hoping someone who is more knowledgeable on the topic could help me. 

Some people say that our extensive pollution of CO2 is actually beneficial to the Earth, because ""plants eat CO2! This creates more plants and we get MORE oxygen! We should burn more fossil fuels"", and it got me to thinking about the logistics and the science behind reforestation.

&amp;#x200B;

As I see it, this is the issue with the idea that plants can save us from climate change:

Before we started burning fossil fuels and adding carbon to the natural cycle, Earth had a certain coverage of forests/green areas. Consequently, the global ecosystem was in balance. Since then, we have repurposed green areas and forests for other uses, all the while continuing to inject more carbon in the the ecosystem. Today, the carbon content in the global ecosystem is much higher than it was 200 years ago. 

So, I was thinking, suppose that plants could in fact be used to save us from climate change and to negate the average temperature increase that we are projected to have. Wouldn't this require that the global coverage of forests/green areas would have to exceed the level it was on initially? I haven't looked up what the coverage was 200 years ago, nor have I checked how much carbon can actually be absorbed in plants at a global scale, but I was wondering if this ""plants will save us"" argument is viable or not.

What is the opinion of the scientific community on Natalia Shakhova and her work?,"Hi all, so I recently saw posted here this [video series](https://www.yaleclimateconnections.org/2019/02/methane-hydrates-what-you-need-to-know/) from Yale Climate Connections, which contained an interview of Dr Carolyn Ruppel of the USGS, part of which was included in [this](https://youtube.com/watch?v=DzUmjU4lwAU) recent video. Reading through the comments is a bit of a shitshow with both climate alarmists and denialist’s criticizing it for disagreeing with both of them and very little actual good discussion unfortunately (but that’s the norm for YouTube it seems).

I have an interest in learning more about the role of methane feedbacks, particularly from gas hydrates. However it can be hard as a layman to make sense of a lot of the conflicting views on this topic, ranging from the seemingly more accepted view that methane hydrates will pose little threat this century, to the extreme view that methane hydrates will go off and bring about the apocalypse within our lifetimes.

Which brings me to Natalia Shakova. It seems like the more alarmist voices consider her findings to be the gold standard when it comes to this topic, and from what I can tell most of the methane alarmism that has become recently popular largely originated with her findings on the East Siberian Arctic Shelf and her concerns of a large release being feasible.

"Debunking ""climate skeptics,"" part 1. There is no greenhouse gas effect.","Hi guys! I'm thinking about making a series of posts debunking various ""climate skeptic"" arguments. First, I'll say that ""climate skeptic"" is a poorly defined term, but that seems to be the self-identification a lot of these people use. These ""climate skeptics"" run the gamut from fairly reasonable people like Judith Curry to nutjobs like Anthony Heller. Maybe I'll get to him later.

So today's post is about people who don't even think there is a greenhouse effect. I've argued with several people like this in a different climate subreddit. There's even a paper by Nikolov and Zeller (2017) about it (see sources below).

There's a fun little story about these guys. So there was a paper published by Volokin and ReLlez (2014), well, it turns out that's just Nikolov and Zeller spelling their names backwards. So I guess now it's Nikolov and Zeller (2014). Anthony Watts wrote about this. In case you're not aware, Anthony Watts runs [wattsupwiththat.com](https://wattsupwiththat.com), a ""climate skeptic"" blog, so you might expect they would have a sympathetic view towards the paper. Here's what Watts had to say about it ([https://wattsupwiththat.com/2016/09/14/climate-skeptics-behaving-badly/](https://wattsupwiththat.com/2016/09/14/climate-skeptics-behaving-badly/)):

""Submitting a paper with your names reversed? I’m sorry… **This. is. just. stupid.** And I agree with Gavin, the paper itself is nonsense. Their work has been the same sort of “pressure rules the temperature of planetary atmospheres” nonsense that the irascible Doug Cotton pushes…under multiple fake names to try to get attention, here and elsewhere. Now they seem to have followed his lead.

I’ve had experience with these two people, Nikolov and Zeller before….and it has not been a good experience. There’s some behind the scenes ugliness they presented in email that I don’t plan to talk about. That’s why I don’t carry their views anymore and never will again, that’s doubly true now after this sad move with the fake names.""

Anyway, enough of the silly drama, let's look at what the papers say. So the standard view of the greenhouse effect is (Schmidt 2010):

""The global mean greenhouse effect can be defined as the difference between the planetary blackbody emitting temperature (in balance with the absorbed solar irradiance) and the global mean surface temperature. The actual mean surface temperature is larger (by around 33°C, assuming a constant planetary albedo) due to the absorption and emission of long‐wave (LW) radiation in the atmosphere by a number of different “greenhouse” substances.""

In other words, without an atmosphere, earth's temperature would be \~33 degrees Celsius cooler. So Nikolov and Zeller (2014) calculate the difference, using unconventional methods, as \~90 degrees Celsius:

""Physical evidence is presented that Earth’s ATE should be assessed against the temperature of an equivalent airless body such as the Moon rather than a hypothetical atmosphere devoid of greenhouse gases. Employing the new temperature formula we show that Earth’s *total* ATE is \~90 K, not 33 K, and that ATE = GE + TE, where GE is the thermal effect of greenhouse gases, while TE &gt; 15 K is a thermodynamic enhancement independent of the atmospheric infrared back radiation. It is concluded that the contribution of greenhouse gases to Earth’s ATE defined as GE = ATE – TE might be greater than 33 K, but will remain uncertain until the strength of the hereto identified TE is fully quantified by future research.""

So, unusual, but if true this would seem to indicate that traditional estimates of the total greenhouse effect are actually underestimates, with some (at that point) nebulous additional contribution raising the global temperature.

Nikolov and Zeller (2017) runs this even farther off the rails:

""A key entailment from the model is that the atmospheric ‘greenhouse effect’ currently viewed as a radiative phenomenon is in fact an adiabatic (pressure-induced) thermal enhancement analogous to compression heating and independent of atmospheric composition.""

According to them, planetary temperatures are only dependent on top-of-the-atmosphere solar irradiance and total surface atmospheric pressure. How'd they come to that conclusion? It's an interesting case, the paper may look convincing on the surface. Roughly, they came up with a bunch of regression models using physical parameters for various solar system bodies, found one that seemed to show that the surface temperature could be calculated using solar irradiance and atmospheric pressure, then concluded that only those two variables contribute to planetary temperature.

This blog post ([http://rabett.blogspot.com/2017/08/making-elephant-dance-as-performed-by.html](http://rabett.blogspot.com/2017/08/making-elephant-dance-as-performed-by.html)) breaks it down some more:

""So briefly, what goes on is to fit the five average surface temperatures of five plants or moons (Venus, Earth, the Moon, Mars, Titan and Triton.  Wait you say, that's six, not five, but they leave Titan out of the mix because  (Eli told you this would be yummy) to an arbitrary functional form

y = *a* exp(*b*x) + *c* exp(*d*x)

Wait you say again, ok, that is four parameters and the functional form plucked out of thin air, but what is *x* and *y.*  That's kind of interesting and more than a bit light fingered but you have to watch the moving cup.  The independent variable is a ratio of pressures *(Ps/Pr)*.  *Ps* is the pressure at the surface, *Pr*, well that's interesting, *Pr* starts out as the ""*minimum air pressure required for the existence of a liquid solvent at the surface, hereto called a reference pressure (Pr)*"" but about a page further on it morphs into

&gt;For a reference pressure, we used the gas-liquid-solid triple point of water, i.e., *Pr*=611.73Pa \[38\] defining a baric threshold, below which water can only exists in a solid/vapor phase and not in a liquid form. The results of our analysis are not sensitive to the particular choice of a reference pressure value; hence, the selection of *Pr* is a matter of convention.

The alert out there have noticed that the minimum air pressure required for the existence of a liquid solvent at the surface kind of depends on the temperature of the surface, and would vary widely from planet to planet. Of course worry bunnies like Eli might ask:  What liquid?  Water exists as water on the surface of the Earth, if there was any as steam at Venus and as ice at all the others if it exists there at all.  For Venus maybe CO2, but at the surface of Venus CO2 is a supercritical fluid and you can't tell the difference between liquid and gas.  At Titan, there are oceans, but oceans of methane, so any useful *Pr* is going to be wildly different for all of these bodies and, in the case of the Mars, and Triton some pretty fancy liquids are going to be needed.

Selection of water as the solvent of choice is then both arbitrary and unphysical.  But why do Nikolov and Zeller insist on using it? Turns out their elephantine trunk waving depends on using dimensionless variables, but restricting *Pr* to an inappropriate value independent of the planet is equivalent to stripping the units off of the surface pressure *Ps*.""

&amp;#x200B;

So, the paper is a good example of how, with enough statistics and cherry-picking, and enough variables, you can come to almost any conclusion you want. It is to be expected that you would find a correlation between atmospheric pressure and planetary temperature; planets with a denser atmosphere generally have more greenhouse gases. Of course, the paper fails to explain the TOA absorption spectrum or other evidence for the greenhouse effect ([http://geosci.uchicago.edu/\~rtp1/papers/PhysTodayRT2011.pdf](http://geosci.uchicago.edu/~rtp1/papers/PhysTodayRT2011.pdf)). Am I being too dismissive? Well, in the more rational parts of ""climate skeptic"" world, the paper was also dismissed. I usually take anything published at wattsupwiththat with a big grain of salt, but here ([https://wattsupwiththat.com/2012/01/13/a-matter-of-some-gravity/?fbclid=IwAR1Lkiqzw8bCx06u5ABMQMfevy0bweKzZfdBatFOIj0aWTAmi\_HrcKEYJDQ](https://wattsupwiththat.com/2012/01/13/a-matter-of-some-gravity/?fbclid=IwAR1Lkiqzw8bCx06u5ABMQMfevy0bweKzZfdBatFOIj0aWTAmi_HrcKEYJDQ)) Eschenbach does a decent job explaining why the hypothesis of Nikolov and Zeller violates the law of conservation of energy:

""I hold that with a transparent GHG-free atmosphere, neither the hypothetical “N&amp;Z effect” nor the “Jelbring effect” can possibly raise the planetary temperature above the theoretical S-B temperature. But I also make a much more general claim. I hold it can be proven that there is **no possible mechanism involving gravity and the atmosphere** that can raise the temperature of a planet with a transparent GHG-free atmosphere above the theoretical S-B temperature.

The proof is by contradiction. This is a proof where you assume that the theorem is right, and then show that if it is right it leads to an impossible situation, so it cannot possibly be right.

So let us assume that we have the airless perfectly evenly heated blackbody planet that I spoke of above, evenly surrounded by a sphere of mini-suns. The temperature of this theoretical planet is, of course, the theoretical S-B temperature.

Now suppose we add an atmosphere to the planet, a transparent GHG-free atmosphere. If the theories of N&amp;K and Jelbring are correct, the temperature of the planet will rise.

But when the temperature of a perfect blackbody planet rises … the surface radiation of that planet must rise as well.

And because the atmosphere is transparent, this means that **the planet is radiating to space more energy than it receives.** This is an obvious violation of conservation of energy, so any theories proposing such a warming must be incorrect.

Q.E.D.""

And some more criticism of Nikolov and Zeller from blogs (no one has bothered to publish a rebuttal in the literature):

There is no greenhouse gas effect. Hi guys! I'm thinking about making a series of posts debunking various ""climate skeptic"" arguments. First, I'll say that ""climate skeptic"" is a poorly defined term, but that seems to be the self-identification a lot of these people use. These ""climate skeptics"" run the gamut from fairly reasonable people like Judith Curry to nutjobs like Anthony Heller. Maybe I'll get to him later.

So today's post is about people who don't even think there is a greenhouse effect. I've argued with several people like this in a different climate subreddit. There's even a paper by Nikolov and Zeller (2017) about it (see sources below).

There's a fun little story about these guys. So there was a paper published by Volokin and ReLlez (2014), well, it turns out that's just Nikolov and Zeller spelling their names backwards. So I guess now it's Nikolov and Zeller (2014). Anthony Watts wrote about this. In case you're not aware, Anthony Watts runs [wattsupwiththat.com](https://wattsupwiththat.com), a ""climate skeptic"" blog, so you might expect they would have a sympathetic view towards the paper. Here's what Watts had to say about it ([https://wattsupwiththat.com/2016/09/14/climate-skeptics-behaving-badly/](https://wattsupwiththat.com/2016/09/14/climate-skeptics-behaving-badly/)):

Climate Change Company(?),"Okay so I have an idea. I wanted your guys opinion on this and to get this off my chest . But first of all, please excuse any typos, misspellings, and grammatical errors thank you.

I have this idea of a company being started that its sole purpose it’s to try and prevent pollution and reverse damage that’s already been done. A company which uses multiple ways of reducing carbon emissions and pays their employees in a different way. It would provide the employees a place of living and provide necessities like water, the company would be self-sufficient where there are jobs broken up into different areas such as resource gathering departments(which would focus on gathering water, planting and harvesting food, and such), science and engineering departments(creating and building new or more efficient ways to improve carbon emission reduction and such), and other areas like construction crew, safety crew, etc. A company which grows by hiring people who are willing to do work for a place to live, eat, grow, and help make a difference in this world. Obviously the pay would not be limited to only residency and basic necessities. Many of the jobs on its company would include, creating energy from people power such as riding a bike/treadmill generator or planting trees and such.

Couldn’t find a flaw in this conspiracy about an alternative cause of global warming,"Humans consume 10 million gigatons of water each year. 70% of that is used to water  plants in agriculture (1). The water on the fields has 3 ways to go:
 - sinking deep into lower levels of the soil 
 - evaporate 
 - being absorbed by the plants (what also eventually leads to evaporation, because plants evaporate water over the leaves)

Actually farmers try to increase field water efficiency (fraction of water used by plants to total water used) but let’s say only 10% evaporate. That means 700 000 gigatons of water evaporate each year. Most of it by Irrigation. Rivers are redirected and spread over huge agricultural areas. On that area the sun developes enough energy to evaporate the water while it would just run into  the ocean without human influence. So we are basically evaporating rivers all over the world. And that is much more efficient than digging for coal and burn it.

But what about rain? Water doesn’t stay in the atmosphere!

Yes, and that’s why many reliable sources claim human couldn’t influence water content in the atmosphere. Because it comes down again, it can’t increase, can it? Yes of course it can. The numbers of airplanes in the air is increasing even though they don’t stuck in the air. Around 16000 planes are in the air right now (2019) and this number is going to increase. Around 200000 takeoffs  every day, which means around 8000 take offs per hour. An average flight duration of 2 hours means, that when you take off, 16 000 other planes take off before you land. And if you increase the take offs per hour you will have more planes in the air, even if the average duration remains at 2 hours.
So the same thing with water. Water remains about 10 days in the atmosphere (2). As mentioned earlier, 700 000 gigatons are evaporated each year. That means 2000 gigatons per day. So within the 10 day lifetime of water 20 000 gigatons are  evaporated due to human influences. Compared to CO2 we emit 30 gigatons each year. according to the simple calculation above we increased the water content much more than we increased CO2. And that while H2O is a much more potent greenhouse gas than CO2. That would mean water vapor is the main cause of global warming!

Why can’t we measure the increase of water?

A gas needs around 1 year to reach each part of the atmosphere and even longer to be homogeneously mixed in the atmosphere. Since the lifetime of CO2 is so large, it actually is almost homogeneously mixed in the atmosphere. That means if you measure CO2 in only one spot, you know the content on alle other spots, because it’s the same.
H20 however has a short life time. The water content varies extremely in different location. When you see clouds, the water content is higher in the cloud than right next to it. You would need an infinite amount of measure spots to estimate the global water content in the atmosphere. Secondly the water content is around 2%. 2.43% or 2.44% is an increase by less than 1%. But for CO2 a difference between 0,03 and 0,04 is significant enough to be measured.

But we can’t add water to the atmosphere!

I never understood this argument. Ever hang out wet laundry? It dries in the sun. The water doesn’t disappear, it evaporates and is in the atmosphere. If the relative humidity (RH) was 100% the clothes wouldn’t dry. Sweating would be inefficient and you would have fog. At 100% RH you need to heat the air in order to take up more water. However when RH is below 100% it can take up more water. That’s the definition of RH. And as we observe in daily life, 100% RH is not common on surface altitude. That’s how sweating works, water is evaporating from the skin to cool the skin. And that’s possible without heating up the air, otherwise evolution wouldn’t have given us the ability to sweat.

Possible mistakes/errors

* most trivial would be a failed conversion between gigatons, cubic meter, kg etc.. because we are talking about millions of gigatons it’s possible. I think I did it right but maybe double check.
* error in the basic concept: maybe I overlooked something. Most likely the point why humans can’t add water to atmosphere. Many sources claim we have to heat up the air to increase water content. But I don’t understand why. I think it would be true at 100%RH but below we can ofcourse evaporate water as we observe in daily life. In Chile millions of liter of water are pumped to the surface and evaporated by the sun because in the remaining salt Lithium can be found. I think I gave enough example why I think we actually can evaporate water. The claim we can’t sounds so stupid to me, I don’t know why everyone says that.
* some more complex phenomenon is involved. Maybe water evaporated from agriculture has a different life time. A few hours would be enough though. The amount of water evaporation is so much higher than the CO2... Also i don’t see why water vapor from humans would behave different than natural vapor. We are basically just wetting the earths surface. Then the sun does the rest in natural processes.

I think it’s more likely I did a mistake and that most of other scientists are right. However I didn’t find a flaw here. Most people I explained this to blamed me as a sceptic but didn’t have any scientific argument. I’m open to discussion but I hope you are open too and can consider my thoughts scientifically and neutrally even though it’s against the consensus.
Thank you.

Are we still heading towards a RCP 8.5 World?,"I have a decent feeling that we'll be hitting peak carbon emissions soon. The coal industry is slowly crumbling, renewables such as solar are outpacing coal and are becoming exponentially cheaper. Many countries (and even US states) are beginning to lower emissions. Even China is supposedly peaking emissions soon as it replaces it's coal production with renewables as it transfers to a service economy. 

And yet, I'm hearing it'll take ~20 years for most of the coal plants currently running to be decomissioned. France is reporting 110 F weather in a bitter heatwave. I'm hearing that even our exponential progress with reducing emissions, bit by bit, are not enough to keep us under a 3 or 4 C future.

Are we still heading towards a RCP 8.5 World? Or have we begun to veer more towards a less catastrophic 6.0 or 4.5 world?

What makes climate change now different from previous periods of climate change?,"I should start out by saying I’m in no way trying to deny human-caused climate change! I’m just curious as to whether there are differences between climate change now and previous periods of climate change. 

I recently listened to a podcast on ice ages, and it explained how the planet has been through a lot of periods of warming and cooling. It got me thinking, life on earth has survived these periods and it seems fairly natural, so what makes the current period of man-made climate change different? I think it’s easiest to just list my questions below. 

1.) There’s a lot of talk of more extreme weather events because of climate change. Was this the case during periods of climate change hundreds of millions of years ago as well? Or is it specific to climate change now? 

2.) If the planet has already been through periods of climate change, is there anything that makes this period unique? Is it faster? Are the gases in the atmosphere different? 

3.) Is the reason climate change now is so bad because it’s also coupled with other human-caused phenomena like industrial agriculture and deforestation?

A thought about climate change.,"If you spill petrol on snow it melts.. It does try it.

So what if the snow melting is not global warming but something else??..

I have an idea what else it could be..

&amp;#x200B;

Imagine the smoke from all the cars?.. When the smoke blows all over the world the rain comes down and mixes with the smoke creating rain with petrol in it??.. And when it hits the floor its like spilling petrol all over the snow?..

But way milder than petrol ..watered down petrol.. Some say acid rain??..NO not acid rain.

&amp;#x200B;

Just think if you light a fire and pour pure water over the smoke the water is not pure anymore its mixed with the smoke.

And what ever is in the smoke will be in the water in less amounts because of the water added..

&amp;#x200B;

The fact its got nothing to do with the earth heating up.. Just pure water as in rain soaking it up and putting it back on the land with snow on it..  And smoke blows all over the place ..

&amp;#x200B;

More people in Canada .. Smoke getting blew all over Canada with the rain coming down will hit the snow and melt it faster.. Like petrol in the snow but diluted petrol from the rain pouring down..

&amp;#x200B;

Green land more smoke created ..Blows over the antarctica snow fall captures the smoke with petrol in it..

They call it acid rain   BUT  they sayits because of the earth heating up when it has nothing to do with the heat ..

&amp;#x200B;

It was all to do with the smoke..   Get smoke pour PURE WATER over it and test the water ..

And we have smoke blowing everywhere .. All over the world .. 

those parts it rains or snows will fall all over the smoke and melt the ice caps ..

those parts it rains or snows will fall all over the smoke and melt the ice caps ..

"We may as well give up, and learn to live with 3-4C warming ..."," [https://www.axios.com/paris-agreement-countries-meeting-pledges-1261f497-3ec7-4192-ba21-83ae339762be.html](https://www.axios.com/paris-agreement-countries-meeting-pledges-1261f497-3ec7-4192-ba21-83ae339762be.html) 

&amp;#x200B;

Not one of the top 10 emitter countries meet its current Paris agreement target. Even if all the countries meet its current goals, that put us to a 3C warming ( [https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/12/07/climate/world-emissions-paris-goals-not-on-track.html](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/12/07/climate/world-emissions-paris-goals-not-on-track.html) ), very much short of hitting 2C, and 1.5C is basically a pipe dream. 

&amp;#x200B;

In fact, 6 of the top 10 emitter countries, including us, are in the highly/critically insufficient categories, which basically are emitting towards 3C+/4C+. 

&amp;#x200B;

And these are the ""easy"" goals. The basic premise for the Paris agreement is that reaching the ""easy"" goals will bootstrap countries to be more ambitious. Since almost no one who matters reaches the easy goals, there is little hope (at least for me) that we are going to reach the more ambitious ones. Some may wish for some miracle carbon capture tech that saves the day. But wishing is not a strategy. There is no indication that such a tech (and the necessary scale up) is going to be available soon.

&amp;#x200B;

And i also ask myself .. why no countries step up enough. The answer is clear. Humans are basically selfish and myopic. You can blame the politicians. But look at what the voters and the public chose in Brazil, Australia and even here in the US. Even the French yellow jackets are against a carbon tax. Basically people care more about their immediate livelihood than saving the planet (i.e. don't tax me and ask me to walk to work)

&amp;#x200B;

I am sure many are going to try to move minds. Many are going to create a lot of noises. Personally i do not believe we are going to avoid 2C+, probably 3C or even more .. given all the issues about permafrost de-frosing well in advance of projection. The good news is that in a rich country like the US, as long as I do not live close to the coast (which I do not, and will not), survival is probably not a problem. There will be addition heating/cooling and maintenance costs but the US (and other first world countries) will probably be fine.

Dangers of air pollution - another argument for climate crisis?,"I've been reading a lot of information and debates on the climate crisis lately, and furthermore been finding a lot of people simply stating that greenhouse gases aren't an issue, all the scientific evidence is faked and flawed, that this isn't due to humans, etc. I often don't know where to start with debating these. I think part of that reason is that we have a lot of arguments and information, but it may be the same thing being used over and over again. Don't get me wrong, this is crucial and undeniable information. But if someone isn't going to listen to it, I figure I should think of a new way to debate it. 

So I've been thinking about some new points to use, specifically about carbon and other GHG emissions. Here's the one I think may be pretty solid:

**Greenhouse gases and air pollution are extremely dangerous to all people living in an effected area.** 

I think about large cities in countries such as India and China. These places have so much air pollution (which is quite obviously due to the human activity) and it is very harmful to the people there.

&gt;Dangerous weather conditions such a acid rain and smog have created hazards for Indian citizens. Acid rain contains hydrogen ions, which can damage trees, crops, harm marine animals and destroy metals. Sometimes the damage that is done from acid rain can be devastating. Smog causes harmful health effects in humans and animals.  Studies have shown signs of black lung disease in dolphins of due to high concentrations of carbon particles in the air. The effects of smog can be irreversible, impacting someone's future health greatly.  
Unfortunately, aside from strange yet dangerous weather, frequent exposure to polluted air increases the risk of cardiovascular disease. This restricts many Indians from exercising, since that's when air consumption is used more rapidly.  Breathing air that is filled with small particles can increase the chance of getting hardening of the arteries, triggering cardiac arrhythmia or even having a heart attack. Statistics show that annual premature deaths caused by particulate air pollution have increased by six times since the year 2000.

(quote from the India Pollution Project)

On top of this, the Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute in India found that 2.2 million Indian children are affected by lung damage that they will carry the rest of their lives - and a UNICEF report listed that air pollution is responsible for 600,00 deaths of Indian children below the age of five every year.

This is something caused by human activity and over emissions, and it is extremely harmful. What happens as countries such as the United States continue to spew so many GHGs into the atmosphere? It will create more dangerous conditions. I know it may not get as severe as these huge cities, mostly due to the really high population densities in these specific examples, but it still goes to show how these things are harmful and detrimental to everyone.

I don't want this to be seen as me saying that other things aren't true arguments, I just feel like we should introduce new ones to people who are truly dead set on denying previous ones. Maybe this isn't even a new idea, I just haven't heard it before in the climate change debate setting. So that's my idea. Is this a good argument? Does anyone have any things to add or point out?

What are your ideas for explaining the science of climate change as easily as possible?,"I was hoping we could have a discussion about easy ways to spread the science! I've noticed that the main issue I have in any climate change discussion is that I don't have enough time to properly explain the science in any way that has real impact. I was hoping /r/climatechange could help me solve this problem. If you have suggestions for other points or other ways to get across those points, I'll add them gladly! Try to be as short and impactful as possible. Here's some topics, and ideas that don't seem very effective because they're too long:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Why gases cause the climate to change:

&amp;#x200B;

(I've been told that this idea misrepesents the information by /u/deck_hand, although I personally think the cause and affect relationship is decent) We know a warm object in a cold room becomes cool, and a cold object in a warm room becomes warm. The earth is sort of like the opposite of a cooler. It keeps us warm in the absolute zero temperatures of space. The power source of this heater is the combination of gases covering the surface that trap heat emitted by the sun. Putting more of these gases into the atmosphere is the converse of putting more ice in the cooler, the planet gets more hot rather quickly.

&amp;#x200B;

From /u/Wallawallawallawa 

2. The reason this is multiplicative:

&amp;#x200B;

When you put ice in a cooler, the cooler and objects inside don't become instantly cold. No, the ice slowly heats up the surrounding air and the objects inside. Then, because it's a cooler, the ice stays frozen for a long while. Even when the ice begins to melt, the temperature doesn't reach above freezing until all of the ice has melted. Now apply that concept to the planet on a global scale. The planet slowly heats up over the course of years due to released emissions, then it will stay like heated while the gases stay trapped in our atmosphere. Whereas the ice melts in a few hours, because of the size of the planet, most of these gases won't leave our atmosphere for 100 years.

&amp;#x200B;

3. The reason it's detrimental:

&amp;#x200B;

Key points could possibly be; sea level rise, increased weather anomalies/anomaly severity with decreased predictability, why the small change in temperature has enough impact to kill off hundreds of species.

&amp;#x200B;

From /u/Wallawallawallawa:  We are currently on track for warming of close to 4 degrees Celsius by 2100. Temperatures have changed in the past too. The last 200 thousand years or so, we can clearly distinguish 6 ice ages. The last ice age resulted in a build up of a huge glacier across Northern US and Northern Europe. New York was buried under 1 km of ice. The ice reached higher than the skyscrapers do today. The global temperature difference then with respect to today: 4 degrees Celsius 

&amp;#x200B;

From /u/Macralicious:  A warming climate produces more extreme weather events, and this has a detrimental impact on our ability to grow food. Right now for example, huge swathes of farmland in the US are waterlogged and this season's crops are therefore in danger of failing. In the UK, the average size of potatoes was down, and in Italy they lost about 59% of their olive yield. They sound like ""cute"" stories, but both were attributed to more frequent extreme weather affecting the growth of the crops. If the anomalous weather becomes too frequent, the serious issue is obvious. This also affects wild animals, whose food sources will be disrupted.

&amp;#x200B;

~~4. Why we don't see the affects in a lot of the first world:~~

4. How different areas see different affects:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

From /u/Wallawallawallawa: Of course there is lobbying of green groups, but that doesn't mean they're wrong. And wouldn't you expect there to be more lobbying by powerful oil interests?""  Exxon instead buried this knowledge and ferociously lobbied against the it. All of this was uncovered by pulitzer prize nominated research journalism. Please do give it a read. - [https://www.pulitzer.org/finalists/insideclimate-news](https://www.pulitzer.org/finalists/insideclimate-news)",1,"What are your ideas for explaining the science of climate change as easily as possible? I was hoping we could have a discussion about easy ways to spread the science! I've noticed that the main issue I have in any climate change discussion is that I don't have enough time to properly explain the science in any way that has real impact. I was hoping /r/climatechange could help me solve this problem. If you have suggestions for other points or other ways to get across those points, I'll add them gladly! Try to be as short and impactful as possible. Here's some topics, and ideas that don't seem very effective because they're too long:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Why gases cause the climate to change:

&amp;#x200B;

(I've been told that this idea misrepesents the information by /u/deck_hand, although I personally think the cause and affect relationship is decent) We know a warm object in a cold room becomes cool, and a cold object in a warm room becomes warm. The earth is sort of like the opposite of a cooler. It keeps us warm in the absolute zero temperatures of space. The power source of this heater is the combination of gases covering the surface that trap heat emitted by the sun. Putting more of these gases into the atmosphere is the converse of putting more ice in the cooler, the planet gets more hot rather quickly.

&amp;#x200B;

From /u/Wallawallawallawa 

2. The reason this is multiplicative:

&amp;#x200B;

When you put ice in a cooler, the cooler and objects inside don't become instantly cold. No, the ice slowly heats up the surrounding air and the objects inside. Then, because it's a cooler, the ice stays frozen for a long while. Even when the ice begins to melt, the temperature doesn't reach above freezing until all of the ice has melted. Now apply that concept to the planet on a global scale. The planet slowly heats up over the course of years due to released emissions, then it will stay like heated while the gases stay trapped in our atmosphere. Whereas the ice melts in a few hours, because of the size of the planet, most of these gases won't leave our atmosphere for 100 years.

&amp;#x200B;

3. The reason it's detrimental:

&amp;#x200B;

Key points could possibly be; sea level rise, increased weather anomalies/anomaly severity with decreased predictability, why the small change in temperature has enough impact to kill off hundreds of species.

&amp;#x200B;

From /u/Wallawallawallawa:  We are currently on track for warming of close to 4 degrees Celsius by 2100. Temperatures have changed in the past too. The last 200 thousand years or so, we can clearly distinguish 6 ice ages. The last ice age resulted in a build up of a huge glacier across Northern US and Northern Europe. New York was buried under 1 km of ice. The ice reached higher than the skyscrapers do today. The global temperature difference then with respect to today: 4 degrees Celsius 

&amp;#x200B;

From /u/Macralicious:  A warming climate produces more extreme weather events, and this has a detrimental impact on our ability to grow food. Right now for example, huge swathes of farmland in the US are waterlogged and this season's crops are therefore in danger of failing. In the UK, the average size of potatoes was down, and in Italy they lost about 59% of their olive yield. They sound like ""cute"" stories, but both were attributed to more frequent extreme weather affecting the growth of the crops. If the anomalous weather becomes too frequent, the serious issue is obvious. This also affects wild animals, whose food sources will be disrupted.

&amp;#x200B;

~~4. Why we don't see the affects in a lot of the first world:~~

4. How different areas see different affects:

&amp;#x200B;

Should talk about the atmospheric system and how heat is distributed out around the planet from the equator, thus equatorial countries take the brunt. Could possibly bring up the increased rate of expansion of the Sahara. The changes then occurred over approx 10000 years. We're achieving the same increase in as little as 100 years.

Since i'm done believing in people managing to vote for some guy in every country that would do something about CO2, any dictator deciding they should think about their grand children... there ain't much more that can be done in time to avoid rising sea.

Study - Air temperature changes in the arctic from 1801 to 1920 -,"Link to the study:

https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/joc.1918

This is an overlooked study that comes to very different conclusions about past arctic temperatures than do proxy studies. 

Some key points:

 - ""On average, the Arctic as a whole was colder by 0.8C"" 

(Which is exactly the global rise reported today) 

 - ""Annual mean temperatures in all the 20-year periods and in all climatic regions were colder than today .... Differences generally are less  than  2C""

 - ""significantly colder autumns were observed in the period 1801 – 1860 in comparison with the
period 1861 – 1920."" 

(That lines up perfectly with LIA conditions)

 - ""The  greatest  discrepancies between the real Arctic and the Subarctic occurred in spring. The former was only a little colder than it is at present (by 0.2C), whereas the latter experienced quite significant cooling (by 1.1C)""

(That shows very little change near the pole and greater change in the sub-arctic. So, the spring melt was slower in most years than we see today}

 - ""... Canadian and Baffin Bay regions, where, on average, April was warmer than today by 0.3C. On the other hand, negative differences (−0.3C, i.e. colder conditions than present) were observed in the Atlantic
and Pacific regions.""

(This implies that there is far more regional variability in arctic temperature conditions than is generally noted)

 - ""The results show that air temperatures in the Arctic from 1801 to 1920 were not as exceptionally cold as has been suggested by some analyses of proxy data""

(So, modern reports of a major increase in arctic temperatures are likely exaggerated.)

 - ""Throughout the whole study period, the majority of mean monthly temperatures lie within one [SD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation) from the modern mean.""

(Which means that about 80% of the measurements are within a normal range of temperature variability)

Most significant is the conclusion that the period 1800-60 was colder in all arctic regions than the period 1861-1920. That means that warming was already occurring in the arctic and sub-arctic well before any warming could be attributed to human causes.",1,"Study - Air temperature changes in the arctic from 1801 to 1920 - Link to the study:

Climate change in Vietnam,"Hi, as South East Asia is ""deemed"" one of the most affected regions due to the upbringing of climate change recently, my school assigned me to do a project on Climate change adaptation in Vietnam and its affection on the Agriculture due to me being a Vietnamese. So I did some research on this and I want to ask the professionals to evaluate and maybe add to my research on this topic. Thank you. 

 

The downstream of the Mekong River in Vietnam conclude the largest areas to be severely affected by the consequences of ecological crisis. A national institute reported that salt-water intrusion had influenced many areas near Mekong River, the salt-water reached into about 70km mainland with an intensity of around 13-30%. Due to the low surface elevation level, high population density, and high dependencies of agriculture and aquaculture, it would have a severe impact on citizen lives and economics. A study shows that by 2100, sea level would rise by one meter, following that is 10% of the population is affected and an estimated 10% loss on the country GDP (Tran Duc, 2019).

In Ben Tre, a province-owned hydro station has measured to a significant rise of 25cm in sea level and drops in fresh rive outflows. At the same time, 4% salinity was recorded in the Co Chien River from 45-52 km inland in April 2013. The expectation for the 4% salinity up-river would have reached 40km in-land by 2040. This put Ben Tre in an unfavorable condition; it’s a province surrounded water, yet it’s inhabitable due to the lack of fresh water to sustain agricultural growth and human consumption (DANIDA, 2013).

Thua Thien Hue is in a critical state of a possible major natural disaster happening within the impact of climate change in recent years. Its terrain varies significantly from the mountain with a peak elevation of 500-1000m down to the plain with a mere 20m above sea level and the sea on the opposite side. As a result, the province only consists of 54% mainland with a tilt of over 25°; the rest is the oceans. Due to this topography, it is essentially creating a periodically consistent main flood which is separated into 4 main types of floods. Winter floods, Late floods, Early floods, and Summer floods. Collected data shows that major surges occur mostly during winter. (Shaw, 2006).

(Ir)rational fear of excessive resource use,"In parallel with the increasing amounts of GHGs that enter our atmosphere, we are also facing the risk of resource scarcity. This is because we (humans) are exploiting our planet's resources unsustainably. Recently, I've begun to be more considerate of this, and I try to limit myself in how much I ""consume"" on a daily basis. There are many aspects that can be discussed in this regard, but today I would like to focus on excessive water use.

I have lived in regions where water has been scarce, and I have learned to appreciate water more. For instance, I keep my showers short, I seldom use an electronic dishwasher (because I don't have enough dishes to fill it up, and therefore consider it wasteful), and I even avoid flushing the toilet if I only needed to pee. However, it sort of stresses me out when I see my friends and family ""waste"" water by taking very long showers (sometimes twice a day), using the dishwasher with only a few plates in (even when plates have only had dry bread crumbs on them), and flushing after every single visit to the toilet.

I know that one argument that can be used is ""well, a kg of meat uses X liters of water, so me taking a shower doesn't really matter"", and I understand and accept this as the harsh reality. However, my anxiety is more because the water we use in our homes are local resources (whereas the beef may have been produced on a different continent), and I am, I would say, ""afraid"" of running out of resources because people are wasteful. 

What are your thoughts on this? How can I get people to appreciate the resources we have and motivate them to use less, without coming across as an A-hole?",1,"(Ir)rational fear of excessive resource use In parallel with the increasing amounts of GHGs that enter our atmosphere, we are also facing the risk of resource scarcity. This is because we (humans) are exploiting our planet's resources unsustainably. Recently, I've begun to be more considerate of this, and I try to limit myself in how much I ""consume"" on a daily basis.

A big climate change reading list,"Hi guys! I've collected a list of sources from discussions over reddit. I figured I would just post a bunch of them here for anyone who's interested in reading them. Roughly organized by topic. Feel free to suggest more sources and I can add them to the list. Some areas are better covered than others.

The Power of Hope and it’s effect on human motivation.,"Hi all!

This is my first post on here, I came here after reading an extremely frightening report on climate change. 

Amongst all the doom and gloom I feel I must observe that throughout history, there have been many scenarios that have seemed hopeless, this might even be the biggest. However we have frequently overcame seemingly insurmountable odds due to hope, ingenuity and the strength of the human spirit. With the universe out there, the solutions exist. 

A social tipping point is coming, progress has new reinforcements everyday while the powers that oppose progress fight a war on two fronts, with progress and the grave. 

If we can all raise awareness and be prepared to begin an industrial and economic green revolution within the next five years we have a chance, we still have the exponential growth of technology to contribute to our efforts. Our futures here CAN be saved, and I have every confidence that they WILL BE. If you don’t have faith in anything else, have faith in the Power of Hope. 

Just to illustrate my point, with exception of those with no means of accessing the knowledge that our climate is changing for the worse, all the most intelligent people in the world across 100s of fields and in nearly all places believe in climate change, so when it comes down to it something will be attempted and it will and should be on a massive scale. 

Good luck everyone!",1,"The Power of Hope and it’s effect on human motivation. Hi all!

My Opinion,"Most of the people around me in my daily life don’t care about climate change whatsoever. However, I personally find it quite disturbing. The thought of a changing globe and the conflicts and problems that come with it, such as rising oceans and and increased extreme weather events make me feel guilty for being one of the contributors to such a horrendous event.
  
Global warming is almost definitely going to happen, and even the naysayers must agree that any work done to prevent climate change could only lead to a healthier planet in the long run. Yet many people choose to ignore al the evidence piling up, such as rising temperatures, sea levels, increased numbers of extreme weather events, and the fact that all these seem to coincide with the massive amounts of greenhouse gases we release into the atmosphere every year. 

I have decided that I will try and reduce my own emissions if no one near me will, if not to set an example then to simply reduce my own guilt.

Carbon pricing for other green house gasses,"How would carbon pricing for methane (86 GWP/20yr), HCF (3790 GWP/20yr), CFC (7020 GWP/20yr), N2O (269 GWP/20yr), and CF4 (4950 GWP/20yr) work?
I chose the 20 year global warming potential because it’s crunch time right now, and we have about 12 years to make serious change, but the values change a lot when talking about 100 year GWP. For carbon pricing of emissions, how would you go about doing it for these other greenhouse gases? Do you have people pay 84 times as much for methan emissions, or 34, which is the 100 year GWP.

What types of man made or natural events would cause a huge jump in global temps?,"Hi all!

&amp;#x200B;

So, I'm writing a book that is set 100 years from now (well, 90ish years). It's got dystopic and apocalyptic themes.. and I was wondering what types of environmental changes would occur in 100 years. I'd like to have the environment play a neat effect in my book, man vs nature, all that jazz. But if it's out of the realm of plausible fiction... then I'll cut that idea.

&amp;#x200B;

**So as for the real question, I was just curious as to what types of events-- any! it could be man-made, environmental, or totally fictional!-- would cause global temperatures to jump to a point that it would change the world around us -- sea levels rising, crops and overall agriculture being affected.** 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm writing in the overall history of my universe right now. My setting is North America, most specifically the Midwest and moving east. I've created a 2030 map that has the US, Canada, and Mexico borders... but i also made a general 2109 map.. where I've made some guesses as to sea levels rising (to a point want as a writer), and I changed country borders and such.

What ive learned about climate change from social media,"Researching solely about climate change from Reddit, here is what ive learned about climate change and my thoughts/viewpoints about it.

__What have you found out about climate change?__

I have found that climate change has become an issue that most people don't usually think about in their daily lives.

Climate change affects not only humans, but wildlife and vegetation. This has been shown through the extinction of certain species.

__What conclusions have you made?__

I have concluded that the affects of climate change are everywhere and people need to change their lifestyles because of it.

__What did you base your conclusions off of?__

I based my conclusion from what I've seen in my every day life, and from what I've seen happens when we continue to cause climate change from our own actions.

__How do your actions affect climate change?__

My actions affect climate change by a small amount, things like not using single use plastics and reducing our energy use. What makes a difference is advising our friends, family, community, and more about what they can do to prevent climate change. If we all change the way we live, (reduce the amount of fossil fuels burned by using more efficient furnaces,etc.) We can make a change.",1,"What ive learned about climate change from social media Researching solely about climate change from Reddit, here is what ive learned about climate change and my thoughts/viewpoints about it.

clean energy question,"Okay so here's the deal, both my grandfathers are very accomplished physicists. While one worked primarily with composites and material science in the French aerospace industry and later NASA and has friends who have worked in nuclear physics. The other has an impressive array of publications in thermo mechanics, collisions etc... mainly in the civil engineering area, namely roads. In the past he has worked on an US/FRA exchange program with the Los Alamos laboratory to compare and exchange data in nuclear physics (probably bombs), he has met original scientists from the Manhattan project including Oppenheimer unless I'm very much mistaken and is good friends with Robert Dautray who is the father of the French bomb.

Both of are pro nuclear and believe nuclear energy is the cleanest we have and will have for a long time to come and considering their background and wealth of knowledge I can't see any reason to not believe them. Having done my own research I believe a combination of nuclear and hydro electric power would be a perfect to have clean renewable energy. So why are law makers backing out of nuclear so much when it is the safest cleanest energy we have available. Heck if I remember my figures correctly Germany's emissions went UP when they stopped the 'reactors. France and Sweden continue to have very low carbon emissions from their power plants for these reasons. I'm pretty sure that the law makers surround themselves with the right people so why are they shutting down nuclear power plants? Why is there not  more education on how nuclear energy works and how safe it is. This confuses me. Why would you turn your back on a highly scalable form of power that happens to be clean and safe.

"""There is a runaway train racing toward us, and its name is climate change""...is not a scientific fact, it's the opposite","Recently a journalistic conference was convened in America (jointly by the *Columbia Journalism Review* and the *The Nation*) to survey the state of American journalism on climate change. 

Criticisms of US coverage abounded — but the criticisms also abounded with errors. In the keynote article ""[The Media Are Complacent While the World Burns](https://www.cjr.org/special_report/climate-change-media.php)"" one finds this passage:

&gt;There is a runaway train racing toward us, and its name is climate change. That is not alarmism; it is scientific fact. 

This statement is definitely NOT a statement of scientific fact — which doesn't deal in metaphors like runaway trains. The statement qualifies as magical thinking at least, and probably alarmism too.

Conference participants presumably had some more substantive criticisms of US climate coverage. Although I bet hardly any of them were more substantive than Chris Hayes' observation from 2018:

&gt; Hayes (who is an editor at large for *The Nation*) replied that his program had tried. Which was true: in 2016, “All In With Chris Hayes” spent an entire week highlighting the impact of climate change in the US as part of a look at the issues that Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump were ignoring. The problem, Hayes tweeted, was that “every single time we’ve covered [climate change] it’s been a palpable ratings killer. So the incentives are not great.”

American journalism covers climate in three distinct ways: 

1) Validating the beliefs of the Climate Denier audience, with the most spectacular assertions one can find which possess a minimum amount of scientific support.  

2) Validating the beliefs of the Climate Doomer audience, with the most spectacular assertions one can find which possess a minimum amount of scientific support. This is what's happening with the ""runaway train"" quote here.

3) Serving the audience which is actually interested in the science of climate. This audience doesn't have many beliefs which go beyond what can be shown by analytic methods. The real task of this strain of journalism is to expand the range of what can be shown by analytic methods. It's probably best to call this strain ""(actual) science journalism,"" rather than mainstream journalism.

It's stupid to fault American journalism (or any journalism) for serving the first two audiences. That's the explicit task of much mainstream journalism: To serve and form a relationship with the largest audience they can reach. Many people are more interested in having their beliefs validated than in having them analyzed (or challenged). These audiences will always exist.

The real question is: How large is that third audience? Is there a chance that it might grow to the size of the other two? If it does, then mainstream journalism will have to yield some space to more ""(actual) science journalism.""

But the keynote article for the CJR/Nation conference gives me no hope that *that* particular set of journalism watchers intends to take a single step in that direction. They're in the validating-beliefs mode, not the analytical mode. 

Plenty of analytical-mode writers publish all the time. There's no need to pay a single moment's attention to the largest mainstream outlets (for instance, network television news operations). But you have to search for them. And complaining about the belief-validating sections of the media doesn't actually make the search easier.",1,"""There is a runaway train racing toward us, and its name is climate change""...is not a scientific fact, it's the opposite Recently a journalistic conference was convened in America (jointly by the *Columbia Journalism Review* and the *The Nation*) to survey the state of American journalism on climate change.

How can an individual engineer have the biggest impact on climate change? (x-post from /r/askengineers),"Hey, looking for a little advice for a friend.  She has a driving need to work to reverse climate change and is trying to figure out the best way to do that.  Do you have any advice for what could be the way that she can have the most impact?

&amp;#x200B;

She has a masters in EE from a top-tier university and has been working in hardware validation for a couple years.  She's also a capable programmer and has been shifting her role to include more CS.  But her current job has nothing to do with the environment or climate change, and she's finding it to be quite a drag.

&amp;#x200B;

Right now, her (incomplete) plan is to go back to school to study chemical engineering, then use that degree as a way to get a job in clean tech.  The long-term goal is to work on carbon capture or trying to remove plastics from the ocean.  It seems to me there are a lot of unknown and undefined steps in her plan.

&amp;#x200B;

So here are a few of my questions:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

1. What's the best way for a young, capable engineer to have an impact on climate change work?
2. Is a degree in chemical engineering a good first step, or would it be a waste of time?
3. What are some companies or organizations where she could work to have an impact?  Preference for the SF Bay Area, but not a limiting factor.  Startups welcome.

Information on carbon emissions by individual companies?,"Hi there,  


I was wondering if anyone knew where to find information on individual companies on their carbon footprint.

  
For example, this article I was reading on McDonald's said they would reduce their carbon footprint by 30% or so, and calculated the resulting metric tons of carbon emissions that would be reduced. This suggests that the current total carbon emissions by McDonald's is known. I can't seem to find this kind of information though anywhere, so I'm not sure where the article got these numbers.  


If anyone could let me know, would be greatly appreciated!

A Deep Dive into Solar Panels.,"12.3 million. The number of homes solar panels were able to power in the US at the end of 2018. Whenever conferring with others about the energy source of the future, solar energy is almost always brought alight. Solar energy is rapidly expanding around the world, as the push for clean energy spreads across the globe. Behind solar energy are solar panels: the panels that absorb sunlight as a source of energy to create electricity for our needs. Ever since 1839, solar panels have been changing constantly and improving greatly to better coincide with the push for 100% clean, renewable energy. The talk around solar panels for the future of the world is undeniably a great amount, but it is also important to acknowledge the history of solar panels, how they work, and their current day status. 
 
Solar energy has been around ever since ancient civilization, but it wasn’t anything like the conventional solar panels seen today used to harness the sun’s energy. It wasn’t until the 1800s when the ball got rolling and solar energy was starting to form like a newly born star in the solar system. Solar energy all started based off an earth-shattering 1839 discovery found by French physicist, Edmond Becquerel. This discovery consisted of the finding of the photovoltaic effect, “a process that generates voltage or electric current in a photovoltaic cell when it is exposed to sunlight,” as Energy Education puts it. Additionally, the discovery of the photovoltaic effect was found while Becquerel was conducting research with a cell comprised of metal electrodes in a conducting solution. Consequently, Becquerel would exclaim, “shining light on an electrode submerged in a conductive solution would create an electric current,” in reference to discovering the photovoltaic effect. Later, in 1873, Willoughby Smith stumbled upon the photoconductivity of selenium, now used in solar panels today. Moreover, in 1876, William Grylls Adams and Richard Evans Day put the photovoltaic idea (originally found by Becquerel) to selenium, finding it could generate electricity when light hit it. To no one’s surprise, someone would eventually put all three discoveries to life which is exactly what happened in 1883, when Charles Fritts created the first ever working selenium cell. Charles Fritts’ newly made cell was an ingenious invention at the time, as he hoped it would compete with Edison’s coal-fired power plants. On the contrary, the new, innovative selenium cell was less than 1% efficient and had no chance of competing with Edison’s coal-fired power plants as the solar cell wasn’t a feasible way of powering millions of peoples lives. Generally, the idea of solar energy wasn’t a popular one at the time and wouldn’t be for a while. Eventually, the concept of solar energy was brought alight when Albert Einstein published a paper on the photoelectric effect and how light carries energy, happening in 1905. Hence, Albert Einstein would win The Nobel Prize in Physics 1921, “For his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect.” He would receive the prize a year later, in 1922.
 
 With the concept of solar energy gaining steam, more specifically the photoelectric and photovoltaic effect, it wasn’t until 1941 when Russell Ohl broke the barrier and invented the solar cell; different than the selenium cell invented by Charles Fritts in 1883. Similarly, like Fritts’ selenium cell, the new solar cell invented by Russell Ohl was incredibly ineffective and not a feasible option to power the lives of many at the time. The energy conversion efficiency of the cell was only 1%, thus for every 100 Joules of solar energy hitting the cell, only 1 Joule of electrical energy was created. While this was an improvement from Fritts’ cell, it wasn’t enough to be used as a legitimate source of energy worldwide, as previously mentioned. The most groundbreaking, substantial invention didn’t come until 1954, when the modern day photovoltaic cell was invented by Daryl Chapin, Calvin Fuller, and Gerald Pearson. After months of long, grueling work, the final product was the first feasible silicon cell ever invented. Originally, Daryl Chapin wanted to make a source of power for telephone systems in remote areas, therefore turning to solar energy as the option. He would later collaborate with Calvin Fuller and Gerald Pearson, as they all invented the cell in unity. Truly, this was the cell of the future as the newly invented cell had a 6% conversion efficiency, much more than the 1941 solar cell invented by Russell Ohl or the 1883 selenium cell invented by Charles Fritts. In fact, the solar call had so much potential The New York Times wrote the newly invented silicon cell, “may mark the beginning of a new era, leading eventually to the realization of one of mankind’s most cherished dreams–the harnessing of the almost limitless energy of the sun for the uses of civilization.” Even though the cell was way too costly at the time to be used by the public or companies (the solar cells costed over $100 per watt), the US military decided to fund research on the cells for the potential to power satellites in the 1950s. The funding persited, and the first ever spacecraft to use solar panels ended up being the Vanguard I in 1958. For some time, solar was still too costly for use until Dr. Elliot Berman did extensive research and was able to produce a much less expensive solar cell, bringing the cost per watt down to just $20, in the early 1970s. Coincidentally, in 1973, the energy crisis hit the US which made oil prices skyrocket forcing the US to turn to other energy options, like solar. In turn, this made the US government committed to developing solar energy (solar panels in specific) as a feasible source of energy for future uses. As a result, Jimmy Carter decided to install solar panels on the roof of the White House to spread awareness and to make a solar energy statement. Evidently, solar panels started to become more feasible as the “golden era” of solar panels for the 1900s hit in the 1980s. 
 
During the 1980s, solar panels started to become much more efficient and cheaper through research and developments. By the 1990s, many groundbreaking creations came out which helped fuel solar panel growth. For example, in 1992, the University of South Florida developed a 15.9% efficient thin-film photovoltaic cell made of cadmium telluride. Just a short time after, in 1994, the first ever solar cell exceeding 30% conversion efficiency was made. 5 years later, in 1999, a photovoltaic solar cell was developed that converted 32.3% of the sunlight that hits it into electricity. Also in 1999,  the new efficiency record for photovoltaic thin-film solar cells was hit marking in at 18.8%. In total, growth between the 1980s and 1990s was crucial to solar panels expanding. Just in 1983, the worldwide photovoltaic production was 21.3 megawatts. In 1999, that number increased to 1,000 megawatts. In conclusion, it is clear the history of solar panels was jammed packed and certainly fascinating indeed. 
 
Today, solar panels work in a very specific way. For solar panels to work, sunlight must be hitting the panel. Obviously, if there is no sun, the solar panels won’t be working at that specific moment. This is why at night, solar panels aren’t working like they are in the day. Anyway, soon after the sun hits the panel, the photovoltaic solar cell absorbs the radiation from the sun. For the sun to hit the cell, it must go through the frame, glass, and encapsulant which makes up the solar panel. Once the sun does hit the cell, after passing through the first stages of the solar panel, electrons begin to move around internally. Nevertheless, a solar cell consists of a layer of p-type silicon placed next to a layer of n-type silicon which are sandwiched between two silicon layers. Inside the n-type, there is an excess of electrons while inside the p-type, there is an excess of positively charged holes. Between the n-type silicon layer and the p-type silicon layer, there is the depletion zone where electrons fill the holes. Once this is completed, the p-type of the depletion zone now contains negatively charged ions while the n-type consists of positively charged ions. Moreover, this creates an electric field which prevents electrons in the n-type layer to fill the holes in the p-type layer. Finally, when sunlight hits the cell, electrons in the holes are ejected resulting in the formation of the holes. All in all, when the p-type and n-type layers are connected with metallic wire or any wire that can generate electric current, the electrons will travel from the sides creating electricity. In a residential solar makeup, the solar panels convert the sunlight into DC energy which is then transferred to an inverter which transfers the electricity to AC for use. For all energy not needed, it goes back to the grid. In conclusion, solar panels aren’t too complicated and work following a basic method. Without the method present, solar panels wouldn’t be able to function as they do. 
 
In today’s era, solar panels are becoming increasingly more prominent and have been over the last few years. In the last decade alone, solar has experienced an average annual growth rate of 50% amongst the US. Furthermore, there are currently over 240,000 Americans working in the solar industry with over 10,000 companies per state. In discussion with cost, the cost to install solar has rapidly dropped by more than 70% in the last decade with the average price per watt only being anywhere from $2.67 to $3.43 now. Comparing the prices to 70 years ago, there is a huge difference in cost. Currently, most solar is installed in Europe and East Asia which account for over 70% of global installations. The least happens to be in Africa, accounting for less than 1% of total global installations. Installations have been growing like wildfire ever since a jump in 2010. In 2000, there were no installations of solar in the US whatsoever. By 2016, the yearly installation reached almost 14,000 watts across residential PV (photovoltaic), non-residential PV, Utility PV, and Utility CSP. The US has also been emphasizing solar, with the annual additions of new electric capacity always growing each year ever since 2010. In 2010, that number was just 4%. In 2018, it was 29% out of all possible energies. Nevertheless, in the US, California has been a big player in solar with the most installations out of any state coming from California. In fact, California beats the next 9 states combined in terms of annual residential PV installations. By January 1st, 2020, California is making it mandatory for all new homes to come installed with solar panels. In terms of efficiency, most solar panels have above 20% conversion levels now. There are actually 7 different types of solar panels, with different types varying per company. Finally, solar panels can be found in solar farms, on residential homes, and commercial homes primarily. It is good to note solar farms are the most effective ways for solar panels to work and the most prominent way. To illustrate how solar is truly on the rise, the global solar energy sector is projected to reach $422 billion by 2022 up from $86 billion in 2016, according to Allied Market Research. In conclusion, it is clear solar panels are on the rise and becoming the energy choice of the future. Within 10 years, solar will have expanded greatly around the world like it has in the past 10. 
 
Clearly, the history of solar panels is quite eventful, the way they work is very fascinating and complex, and their current day status is very promising. Without solar panels in life, the world would suffer major losses without one of the most popular clean energy options around. Not only this, renewable energy would have to be limited to the current day, less promising options like wind energy. Jobs would also be lost, the economy wouldn’t be the same, and solar companies would seize to exist. In a world without solar panels, what would it be like?

"Supercritical CO2, closed loop Geothermal wells and the promise of universal carbon free base load Renewable power","Yesterday I posted a link to  DOE review of the untapped potential of Geothermal power Plants.  this post is in response to questions posed in comments to that post.

Here are a number of links that will help explain the potential of supercritical CO2 and as I see it, its incredible potential if applied in closed loop Geothermal wells to provide base load Renewable power while sequestering the CO2 working fluids required to drive the power plants.

"As a layman, I believe the main killer of climate change will be all the wars it spurs","I've always said the science behind global climate change, appears to pretty solid, and to me talking to a climate change denier is like debating a flat earther.

I want to run this idea past a couple people on here.

Basically Homo Sapiens is 200,000 years old. Besides maybe ideology, and religion, what has been a main motivating factor for wars? Limited resources, and power and control over those resources. When I play Civ V, I gotta delay my civilization's progress if I aim to take out another, but on a cost/benefit analysis that rival civilization's resources are main motivating factor. And I think we got a similar situation here.

We got 7.6 billion people. Population numbers continuing to rise. This can NOT rise indefinitely. And not when climate change is actually going to affect land areas, I.E. where humans live, profoundly more than out in the middle of the ocean, I suspect land is actually going to get a lot hotter than say 4c.

It's not so much the farm lands being turned to desert and displacement of hundreds of millions from coastal cities that scares me...I think this climate change is going to set off potentially the proverbial WWIII. You're gonna have starving masses similar to Soylent Green, they're going to be pissed. We're seeing the rise of nationalists, I'm not getting into politics, but basically instead of humans figuring out a way to share the earth's resources for their survival, they're looking to horde them to themselves. It's the rise of authoritarianism and a look to strong man dictatorships in major countries, that is leading me to see parallel's to the lead up to the WWII situation, except today's weapons are profoundly more destructive than they were in the 1940's.

IIRC they say one of the reasons we may have yet to ever discover intelligent life is because it figured out how to destroy itself, before it figured out interstellar travel. Right now we got the nuclear arsenal the world over to destroy ourselves as opposed to interstellar travel.

So I just wanted to see what others think of this idea of mine.",1,"As a layman, I believe the main killer of climate change will be all the wars it spurs I've always said the science behind global climate change, appears to pretty solid, and to me talking to a climate change denier is like debating a flat earther.

Why are some people so resolutely opposed to accepting climate change,"i have been posting on many topics  on a different forum for quite a while.  I have done a few posts on climate change. And have noticed that many people are seemingly irrationally opposed to consideration of evidence on the topic.

The most recent topic that i chose was sea level rise. I chose this topic because it seemed to me that the evidence of sea level rise is indisputable.  Not only are sea levels rising, they are rising at an accelerating rate.   ( from 1.8 mm per year in 1900 to about 3.5 mm per year recently)  I asked a simple question:  what is causing this phenomenon?

To me, the only possible explanation is added heat from greenhouse gasses.   But i was open to any alternative explanation that might be proposed.  I got answers like... sedimentation is causing sea level rise, and seismic activity may be reducing the size of ocean basins.  Both of these explanations are easily dismissed since they are long term and constant and therefore could not account for a short term acceleration of sea level rise.  I have had someone argue that in order to accept air temperature readings there would have to be millions  of ground stations all read by a single individual. I have had people argue that any co2 mitigation strategy... no matter how small... would result in the collapse of the world economy. And of course there is the persistent meme that all of the scientists in the world are part if a gigantic plot that requires that the keep producing phony studies in order to line their pockets with government grants.

I have to say that the people proposing these arguments are clearly intelligent, and not obviously insincere.   I find it confounding that they seem to be so rooted in their opposition to this topic that no amount of patience, or rationality will dislodge them from their intractable opposition to open minded consideration of the evidence.

"My dad doesn’t believe in climate change, help?","Can you guys give me some solid evidence of climate change? The fact that my dad doesn’t believe in climate change is making me view him as a sort of flat earther.

I’ve tried showing him evidence that I found myself, like NASA stating that ~97% of climate scientists agree with climate change, and coral reef bleaching.

He’s told be multiple times that it’s not happening, and he says it’s because they thought the ice age was gonna come when he was a kid, but it didn’t happen. We’ve improved our science since then and he still doesn’t understand. He’s also said he’d find me an article against climate change since our last talk about this and he’s failed to do so.

I know I probably won’t be able to change his mind, but I just want to try with some solid evidence this time.

Edit: I’m 15, so it’s probably the fact that I’m just a kid to him is probably affecting this.

How does irrigation affect the climate?,"Water is one of the most important things related to the climate, but I've hardly ever heard talk about irrigation and climate change. But surely irrigation has an effect one way or another, about 2,700,000,000,000,000 liters of water are used for irrigation. Water vapor is a powerful greenhouse gas but precipitates out quickly; clouds, snow, and ice have high albedo; water weathers rocks absorbing CO2; water helps plants absorb CO2; irrigating areas changes their albedo; plants release water via evapotranspiration. 

An example of water vapor being dependent on land use is the Amazon rainforest, which is mostly self-watering by absorbing and transpiring rainwater. Farmland also changes the local water vapor concentration, by irrigating, by forming the land to absorb water rather than have runoff, and by changing rates of evapotranspiration compared to wildland.

Irrigation causes a lot of huge changes, some of which cancel each other. Anyone know what the net effect is?",1,"How does irrigation affect the climate?

Food Towers as a Method to Futureproof?,"Guys,
I've been thinking, and this is what I've thought. As it stands, all we need in life is food, water and shelter, and efficiency is key. I believe the society we live in (I speak as an Australian) is geared towards burning energy to stimulate an economy. Without business, managing the cost of living would become near impossible and many would suffer. The problem I forsee is that the business we promote is unsustainable for the environment and also for ourselves, and we will ultimately run ourselves into the ground. 

[tldr] So here is my idea... Why don't we condense our populus into towers, each of which can support its own capacity of residents through hydroponics. I fear we will be forced to retreat indoors if we leave this climate change issue for too long, and this is a solution I believe could work. 

I would love to hear from each and every one of you, with your thoughts about this and ideas on the topic.

Idea I had,"Remember in 2014 when people were posting video’s of them emptying a bucket of ice over their head everywhere for ALS and people all around the world started doing it and nominating their friends?
What if we started something similar, like for example someone plants a tree, posts pictures of it on social media and nominates their friends to do the same.
The main excuse people have when you ask them why they don’t eat less meat or something like that is that one person isn’t going to save the world. This challenge fixes that problem, as planting just one tree and nominating your friends who in turn nominate other people can create a huge chain reaction.

How does CO2 causes earth to heat up?,"Does anyone have good scientific facts on how CO2 causes global warming?

Air is 21% oxygen, 78% nitrogen and 0.04% CO2. CO2 has gone from 300 ppm to  415 ppm in last century and could get to  500ppm soon. While this is a huge increase in CO2 it is still a very small fraction of the air.  There is not much difference in 0.04% and 0.05%

For sure CO2 gas is a better insulator than  nitrogen or  oxygen. I believe O and N  have r value of about 0.97 per inch while CO2 is 1.5.  However given the small percentage of CO2 in the air,  i suspect it would not change the overall insulation properties of air.

CO2 can absorb infrared radiation whereas oxygen and nitrogen do not. However, again since CO2 makes up such a small fraction of air, I can't see this making huge change in earth's temperature.

The most interesting theories I have heard relate to how CO2 amplifies the amount of  water vapour that air can hold. Since water vapor and clouds have a huge effect on earths temperature this sounds more plausible. The only way I understand how C02 effects water vapour is that CO2 will warm the air, thus warm air holds more moisture. Again we are back to the small percentage of CO2 and could that small percentage have a large impact on the airs moisture content. Maybe there are other interactions at play.

Upwards temperature spiral after 1.5C,So I have seen someone talk about in a YT Video that there is a risk once we reach 1.5C that the temperature will spiral up uncontrollably. That once we reach 1.5C we lose any control of temperature (with the output of less CO2). I have yet to find sources that prove this or explain it. The Sources linked have to be paid so I have not read them. This makes this post kinda stupid but I still wanna know if it is true and why the relationship between CO2 in the atmosphere and the global temperature change at 1.5C.,1,Upwards temperature spiral after 1.5C So I have seen someone talk about in a YT Video that there is a risk once we reach 1.5C that the temperature will spiral up uncontrollably.

How do we know Earth's orbital patterns are not effecting climate change more than humans?,"I know I might get some flack here, and I think we should be doing everything we can to stop the hazardous pollution of our planet, but I am just not convinced it is solely humans that are responsible for the current warming we are seeing. In my recent research I have come across many other natural processes that could lead to the warming of our planet. The history of the climate of this planet is actually far from stable, as only 10,000 years ago, our planet was in a full blown ice age, that we still don't fully understand how it got out of. The orbit of the earth is also very diverse. Aside from the regular orbit and rotation on its axis that cause the 4 seasons, there are factors such as milankovitch cycles, axial obliquity, axial &amp; apsidal precession, and eccentricity to name a few, that could all be effecting how the heat from the sun is dispersed on the surface of our planet, just in a much more subtle way (every 10,000-100,000 years or so).

Another thing is the natural release of CO2 from pockets in the ice, or from volcanic eruptions that release millions of tons of CO2 into the atmosphere in a matter of hours or days.

I would like to reiterate that I think we should be doing everything we can to stop the destructive pollution of our planet. I just think we need to be looking at the bigger picture of climate change as a whole to fully understand the problem we are facing.",1,"How do we know Earth's orbital patterns are not effecting climate change more than humans?

i’m mad about this crappy climate change organization / thoughts on approaching the climate change discussion,"sorry in advance, i really needed to rant.

Today i went to an interview with this organization (rather not name it) that basically advertises itself as on the forefront of fighting climate change, etc. it was advertised as a summer job for students. so first red flag, the job is fundraising, going from house to house to get money. i would get to keep about half. feels a little dirty to me. that is the whole job. talking to people about climate change and asking for money, and then keeping half. oh also if i don’t hit a certain quota per day they don’t have to pay me. so i’m basically working off commission. okay, i’m thinking, this organization needs money to see change happen, i guess i’ll just do my best in the interview and see what happens. 

so i go to the interview. the questions are very forceful and i don’t feel like the woman respects me very much. she nods her head at certain answers and makes small facial indications that she doesn’t like what i’m saying at other times. one thing really jumps out at me: she asks me what i would say to these people to inform them of how important climate change is. i say “well, we’re all in this together and we all need to act to see change happen for us. everyone is affected by this. we need to make sure we’re making the right personal decisions like switching to electric cars for instance and also the right public decisions such as voting and supporting climate change campaigns.” she immediately says “well this isn’t the people’s fault. it’s the industries and the government” and essentially says it’s not up to us (?????) she didn’t say “oh but that isn’t the focus of this campaign” or “but when you talk to people stick to talking about the public side.” no. she literally said essentially that personal decisions don’t make a difference for climate change. i didn’t really know what to do cause i didn’t want to be rude so i kind of nodded. 

then at the end of the interview she said maybe a full paragraph about how many other candidates there were and how qualified they all were and how i had seen them when i was waiting and how they needed to get people on the team fast and that they were actually hiring that very day and then extended the job offer. i was kind of flustered and she pressured me a lot and so i was just like “yes i accept” and agreed to starting the next day and walked out of there feeling super weird and like i had been almost forced into it against my will.

then i was thinking about how weird the whole thing was and i ended up talking with both my parents and they agreed that it seemed kind of fishy and also because i would be commuting (v expensive) i literally could not afford if i didn’t make the quota one day so i figured it’s not worth it to even try because i would lose so much money just by giving it a shot and i could lose a ton of a money even if i did make the quota for a long time. anyways so i decide to call them and say i changed my mind, i felt bad but i also didn’t feel that bad cause i felt i had kind of been pressured into it with no time to think about it. so i call.

so this is the part that really pissed me off. i call to tell them i’m backing out. he says “why, do you not believe in the cause? is climate change not important to you?” and i said “no, it is, but i don’t think i can afford the commute.” and he says, “well we have people who commute from [place farther away than where i live]. isn’t where you live closer?” and i said “yes but this isn’t the right time for me to do this” and he said “well the point of no return is in 12 years, when is gonna be the right time for you?” and then he kept talking about how much the organization is doing to combat climate change and basically asking me if i didn’t care at all, extremely patronizing questions and i eventually said “i respect what you guys are doing but i can’t take the job right now.” 

i hung up from that phone call so angry. i’m so angry right now. i can’t believe this supposedly reputable organization would use tactics like that to keep me in. i’m so glad i got out when i did because they probably would have been just as manipulative if i actually worked with them.

okay, so first of all, how could that woman, the freaking director of this program, possibly say that personal actions have nothing to do with it??? is that just how she sleeps at night? like i don’t understand. how could someone who’s supposed to care about this issue actually say that? it freaking astounds me that that person exists, that people like that could exist. it is everyone that is responsible for climate change. individuals, governments, industry, infrastructure. most parts of the developed world have been built off the backs of fossil fuels. you can’t just turn only corporations into the enemy, or only demand change from the government and that’s it. that is such a freaking victim mentality, such a disempowered position to put yourself in. why would anyone do that expect to feel okay about not trying in their personal life?? i watched a video from hank green (vlogbrothers, i think it was called what game of thrones is really about) talking about how we have ALL benefitted from fossil fuel use. modern society exists today because of fossil fuel use. it’s not about demonizing a certain sect of humanity. it’s about actually moving towards a cleaner and brighter future where we can ALL coexist. demonizing certain people or peoples is not sustainable (no pun intended.) it is only a way to feel better about ourselves. and this is ultimately extremely selfish. we HAVE to take personal responsibility. it is the only way. we have to be humble enough to realize that we are part of the problem too. 

second of all, why would they fucking try to guilt me into staying? what a dumb way to get campaigners. at this point i almost feel like it’s some sort of scam, except that it was with this pretty reputable organization and i’m so angry that they would treat me like that. what i’m most angry about is that it worked. it made me feel like a shitty person. not because i am or think i am but because that’s how he was treating me. this CANNOT be part of the climate change campaign. when we weaponize morality like this, when we say you’re bad for not caring about this. it turns people off. no one is going to listen to you if you’re patronizing in that way. no one is going to listen to someone that talks down to them. person to person respect is the most important part of moving such a huge campaign like this along. WHY would we try to manipulate people? this problem is so real, we have to let the truth speak for itself. trying to manipulate people literally undermines the truth and gravity of the situation. it makes it underhanded instead of honorable to talk about this. we have to find a way to reach people about this without saying they’re bad for not caring about it in the past. i want to make it clear: if you didn’t know or care about climate change before, there should be no judgment on you. by the same token you’re not a “good” person for caring about it. it’s going to kill us. stop trying to pretend your survival instincts make you a saint. (no offense. like we need people who care about it, of course, and like i said i think there is an honor in it. it just pisses me off when people act like they’re above other people for caring about it.) can we stop putting people into categories of good and bad??? this issue is too important for anyone to put their ego into it. it’s not about me or you or anyone else. it’s about how we’re aLL GOING TO DIE! we need to give this issue the respect it deserves. it doesn’t need manipulation. our voices need to be a medium to spread the message, not a way to make us feel self righteous. 

if you’ve made it this far, damn, and thanks. i don’t usually post rants like this but i don’t think i could have let this stupid situation go without getting it out of my system. do you have any thoughts?",1,"i’m mad about this crappy climate change organization / thoughts on approaching the climate change discussion sorry in advance, i really needed to rant.

help choosing between the outdated AR4 Scenarios,"  

Dear climate change community, 

I have a bit of an academic situation and I wanted to know your opinion regarding the subject.  I am a PhD Student, I am doing my PhD in Sustainable Environmental  Architectural Design in the tropics. Anyhow, the thing is I am using this software called Meteonorm  ( [https://meteonorm.com/en/](https://meteonorm.com/en/) ) to generate a series of weather files to generate a territorial climate zoning using the Koeppen method but changing the years of the climate normals, first from 1981 to 1990, then 1991 to 2012 and then a prediction for 2060. My problem is, even though the software is a recent updated version, the thing still uses the AR4 IPCCs scenarios from 2007, thus in order to generate the future files, one must choose between the scenarios B1, A1B and A2. 

At the beginning I had no doubt in using the A2 Scenario, since the last year IPCC special report of Global warming of 1.5°C was a bit alarming and I thought the temperature ranges (2.0 to 5.4 °C) seem to fit on the 100 year predictions, but then I read a paper from 2015 ([https://www.nature.com/articles/srep09957](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep09957) )  which I understood that the most likely scenario was A1B and it made sense, but some years have gone by and thins have evolved a lot in the last years, I understand the AR4 is a bit outdated and the latest reports offer a better and more detailed prediction of what we may encounter but, what would be your recommendation regarding the subject, do you thing conditions may have changed and the A2 is more likely than the A1B? or the A1B still fit the range of possibilities?

Thanks for your time,",1,"help choosing between the outdated AR4 Scenarios

I'm torn between being hopeful and being depressed....,"Does anyone else feel this way?

Most of the time I feel crushing anxiety and depression, and I live in a near-constant state of worry. I am afraid for the world we're leaving for our children, and I am so sad about the effects that global heating has already had on other countries (especially on the most vulnerable). I don't think people are doing enough, and I am pessimistic about our chances to combat imminent threat.

But....

Then, sometimes I try to focus on the positives: the amazing work being done to clean up our planet, the steps we are taking in the right direction, and the fact that IF we can stave off complete annihilation we will have made a world that I actually will want to live in. A world that isnt as greedy, or destructive, or hopeless... a world that puts the earth first, instead of our own selfish species.

I tend to oscillate between the two viewpoints lately, and I'm wondering if anyone else feels the same way?

Arrhenius Equation Question,"I’m new here, so I apologize in advance if I’m doing it wrong. 

I’m trying to find out if there is a published laboratory experiment that proves the validity of the Arrhenius Equation for CO2 global warming temperature rise at multiple-doubled CO2 ppm concentrations and various water vapor saturations?

For instance:

CO2 is put in a cell with dry air at 200-400-800-1600-3200 ppm concentrations and then exposed to solar spectrum. See if the Arrhenius equation holds.

Repeat with moist air at several H2O concentrations to see is any amplification of temperature increase occurs.

Use dry air and no CO2 as a control.

How's our future TRULY looking?,"Recently I've been seeing sources and threads talking about how the likely warming is increasing as models further develop.
Admittedly, I'm not exceptionally knowledgeable on the subject of climate change (at least compared to many others on this subreddit), and I won't pretend I am. I just... reading about everything is terrifying me. I live on the west coast of the U.S. and have no idea how climate change is going to affect my family in the near future. I'm scared something will happen to them, and it kills me that I can't do anything to protect them from something like this.
I suppose what I'm really trying to ask is if there's any plausible reason why we should have hope for the future when our leaders seldom take action and instead make mere proposals. News keeps getting worse and worse, and I don't know how I should respond. What's going to happen to the U.S.? To other regions? What is currently being done that significantly counters the affects of climate change? Realistically, can we stabilize the situation anytime soon, or will I be dead before that happens? I keep seeing others say ""there's always hope for the future,"" but things appear very grim, and what little hope I had is quickly fading.

Sorry if I seem like I'm rambling and asking silly questions. It's late, and I'm tired but very anxious and unable to sleep. I am also sorry if I have depressed anyone else with my ramblings. I am just genuinely scared for my family.

Need some feedback on future plans,"Hi all, hopefully you have been seeing me comment here and there. And I have read the sticky, but still would like some feedback on planning my future.

Background, mid 30s, live in southern semi coastal town, equipment mechanic (former car tech), former car guy (just ""woke up"" to the depth problem in the last few weeks thanks to reddit threads). Not perfect but definitely making steps to do better with my footprint.

So until about a month ago, was still chugging along, working on my project car and commuting to work from the suburbs as most do. Recently lucky enough to find a gf. Plans were to stay renting at my house next 2-3 years then buy my own. 

Now besides the anxiety the future gives me I don't know if I should consider getting a house or keep renting and move when climate change affects the coast too much (unknown if current gf will join). Currently paying off my daily driver as fast as possible so I can put money aside for a used electric/plug in hybrid. But from there.... how to plan? I will stay at my current job due to how we at least keep machines operating at the best they can (and rebuild some that help offset buying a new one).

You read all the potential pitfalls we may of missed in the predictions and who knows what will happen this election cycle. I don't have a lot of faith of people knowing to do what is best for themselves long term. I see how far tech has come in our lifetime (from Oregon trail to red dead 2, from corded wall phones to modern cell phones, the internet in general) but I don't think it will solve the problem in time, just delay it.

Grow up and be responsible as now it is your, turn to manage the world. Be a man or a woman or anything but get some sense that you, filthy mf, are a part of this earth, you shit!

Even as a smart ass businessman the way you conduct your business shit doesn’t make sense.

“How to make $5M in a year” wtf you’ll do with the money when you don’t have a place to live. Oh, Mars, right! And you’ll follow same work ethic there, right? “How to make 6 Martian Millions and find another planet before we fuck this piece of shit again”. 

You want to make money because you don’t want to work right? Who the f\*&amp;k will serve you, my majesty even if you land on Mars. You are getting so horny that you are f\*\*king yourself.

You focus on extracting resources out of every damn thing, you suck the life out of everything (including yourself) and then no doubt, at the end of the day you fill alone; you deserve it my mf son/daughter.

&amp;#x200B;

Wake up. It's time to come to our senses.

How exactly is climate change an existential threat?,"I'm fully prepared for people to roast me for even asking, but I'm trying to be thoughtful about this issue...


I'm all for being prepared for, or better yet, trying to prevent any doomsday scenarios, but I really haven't come to terms with what the doomsday scenario for climate change is.

I could imagine a worst case scenario that in maybe 100-1,000 years climate change has gotten so bad that islands become absorbed by the ocean, or that coastal cities are flooded and the landscape of the world as we know it is forever changed. 

If this scenario occurred I would imagine that potentially millions of people would die or be misplaced, which would be a massive tragedy, but even then, I can't imagine how it would be an existential threat to humanity.

I would assume that humans would adapt and find somewhere on the planet to survive and continue to advance humanity.. Would we not?

To me, that seems like the worst case scenario, which would not be a threat to the existence of our planet or human race, and is still a rather far-off or maybe even far-fetched scenario.

I'm not denying that climate change is real or that it may have massive consequences, but when people describe it as an existential threat, it makes me think that I'm either misunderstanding something or that it's being massively overhyped.",1,"How exactly is climate change an existential threat?

Fear,"Climate Change is something that terrifies me unlike anything that I’ve feared before. When I was younger I feared the dark, slept with a nightlight...it was a blue light. I felt so grown up when I finally was able to turn it off and sleep in the dark. Then I was scared of thunderstorms and how loud they were. I felt so grown up when I could not only see they were harmless (to me being inside a house and all) but that I could fall asleep to them at night. Then I was scared of spiders. One jumped on my shirt and stared at my right in the eyes. They were alien to me. Again, I felt so grown up when I realized they only wanted bugs, not people. And again I could finally feel grown up when I could catch a spider and let it outside without any fear. Then I was afraid of nuclear war. (Quite the jump I know) I kept seeing news about Russia and North Korea that had me frightened about the possibility. I had dreams of mushroom clouds and my family screaming. I will never not be afraid of that. Sometimes when things get too quiet, I get a bit anxious as if I’m expecting a nuke to go off. I don’t think I’ll never not fear that. Then came climate change. Always knew it was happening, never denied it. The IPCC report in October had me on edge but I believed we could do it. I took an ecology class, learned how we could kill the Earth 6 ways from Sunday. I had a couple panic attacks every week for about a month. I feared for my family once again. But it was a different fear because when I looked outside all I was were the trees starting to bloom, the grass swaying in the wind. Everything seemed fine. I guess it was my first taste of what you would call Mortal Fear. The trouble I’m having with this fear is the justification. Its not like a Nuke, its not sudden or a single event. We’ve been harming the Earth for over 200 years and she can only do the same to us in return. Whenever I read about the effects I try to tell myself it won’t be a wave of heat that will turn everything into desert: its a slower, gradual process. And I think thats why my fear is worse than before. Because I’m seeing the beauty that is today and what we will loose should we do nothing. Then I read about the recent happenings in the arctic. Still cant think about it for more than a minute without panicking. Not used to it yet. I try to tell myself even if we do everything right the consequences will still hit us and we deserve it, so just roll with the punches and keep your family safe.

Potential risks of rewilding initiatives?,"I know that rewilding is being talked about as one of the potential ways to mitigate climate change, and I totally understand the rationale behind that.  However, my area (US Rockies) is very prone to wildfires every summer - and fire season is getting longer each year. As the climate continues to change,  we'll be looking at summers (and springs and autumns) that are increasingly hotter and drier, meaning that our fire risks continue to go up. The risk of more destructive fires and megafires continues to rise.

Before I get too excited about the local initiatives to replant trees in burn areas, I can't help but wonder - by planting more trees in my area, are we actually helping? Or are we just providing areas of known fire risk with more fuel that will turn into dry tinder more quickly than it used to? Anyone care to weigh in?",1,"Potential risks of rewilding initiatives?

Climate is a self-regulating system,"No one doubts that the level of carbon dioxide has increased since the 19th century or that this leads to increased global average temperature, measurements and observations in ice and sea sediments show this. But measurements also show that there are natural fluctuations of more than 100 ppm and that nature and the atmosphere is a self-regulating system. The ice sheet builds up at Ice Age and when the temperature rises, the melting ice cools down the increasingly heated seas and works a bit like a thermostat in an ordinary car. Ocean currents change the direction because of temperature changes and if the North Atlantic Current of the Gulf Stream were to end, there would be several degrees colder in the Nordic and British islands, which would counteract the melting of the Arctic ice.

Increased temperature in the oceans leads to stronger low pressure with increased cloudiness and stronger winds. The cloud formation shields the earth from the sun radiation, which inhibits the warming. And the winds bring up dust in the atmosphere, which also filters away energy from inhalation. Along with smoke from the increased number of forest fires from areas with prolonged drought.

There are many self-regulating mechanisms like these. But the deeper and more extensive low pressures will also lead to destruction and flooding. While forests and settlements will be burned down in the hinterland and in high-altitude terrain, floods on rivers and coasts will drowning crops and settlements and destroy drinking water resources. And then the darkness comes. The clouds and dust shield of the earth may after a long cooling process end up with a new Ice Age. Which would be needed as the ice since the mid of the 19th century has melted at an ever increasing rate. And inland ice is not only temperature regulating but a vital freshwater resource.

The current level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere corresponds to a global temperature rise of about 15 degrees Celsius. But this will not mean that we will avoid cold winters and get tropical summers with warm, comfortable nights. Rather, on the contrary, the energy supplement would largely consist of different forms of destructive kinetic energy. In the end, the temperatures will fall and the winds will slow down and eventually the shielding cloud and dust layers will dissolve and the sunshine will once again reach the earth's surface. And a new, more stable climate era starts with new ice resources.

Is a focus on carbon emissions an oversimplification?,"To start with, I'll just let you guys know I'm writing from the perspective of the UK, so my experience of climate change discourse is very much based on discussions happening here. 

Now to my question. This morning I was listening to the radio and the news bulletin said government advisors were claiming we need to switch entirely to electric cars by 2030. The bulletin ended, however, by saying that it was uncertain whether or not enough cobalt could be mined to achieve this goal. 

I've been thinking about this a lot recently. Climate change discourse (in the UK at least) seems very much focused on carbon emissions and getting carbon neutral, to the extent that technological solutions still seem to be the norm in this discourse. I'm talking electric cars, wind turbines, solar panels, etc. Although I advocate all of these methods of renewable energy, are we just going to be swapping one crisis for another? 

I'll explain further. What I mean is, if the UK was to switch to electric cars by 2030, would the intensive mining of cobalt in other countries (I assume you can't mine cobalt in the UK) mean we'll simply be promoting the emission of carbon elsewhere? So even though the UK will be able to say it's carbon neutral (in terms of transport at least), it will basically have offset that by causing more emissions elsewhere.

By swapping the crisis I also mean we'll be swapping a greenhouse gases crisis for a resource crisis. Surely the mining of all these resources will have a huge impact on the landscape and habitats. Furthermore, resources aren't unlimited. 

So my question, essentially, is: is focusing only on carbon emissions and getting carbon neutral an oversimplification of the issue in an attempt to make it easier to sell and understand? Don't get me wrong, I 100% back reducing carbon emissions and going carbon neutral, but I can't help but feel the consequences of this process haven't been considered fully. It seems that, as with the majority of the climate change debate, the vastness of this crisis isn't fully being comprehended and instead simple and quick fixes are being attempted. 

Totally willing to have my mind changed though! In fact, I'd rather someone did change it because my view is a bit depressing/complicated/it makes my brain hurt.",1,"Is a focus on carbon emissions an oversimplification?

Honest skeptic here looking for answers.,"Hi, I’m what some consider to be a “lukewarmer”, or climate agnostic. (Criteria I use: I tend to think the science is strongest for an RCP range of 3-6 not 8.5, and ECS range of 2-4)

I honestly,politely and in an open minded way, seek for answers to the truth that lies between “global warming is a hoax” and “humankind on earth has 12 years to go before certain apocalypse”

I want to do more. What can I do?,"I personally believe that the only solution to climate change is massive institutional change on a governmental level. If the governments of the world act as if this is the dire situation that it really is, we can mitigate the damage before it’s too late. We need to hold our politicians and governments accountable, and we all need to do a lot more to force change in the US (I single out the US because I’m American). I read about mass protests and student walk outs in Europe, and I wonder why this isn’t happening in the US.

I know it’s important that we all do our part, plant trees, recycle, etc.  but the little things that we can do on a daily basis are not enough. It makes me sick that people are not rising up and demanding action now...  but sadly, I am also one of those who is talking the talk but not walking the walk.

I’m an American living in Asia. I have a life here, and I don’t know when I’ll be coming back to the US to live. I’m not really in a position to be organizing protests in the country that I live in... and I live in a big city where I can’t plant trees. We all have daily lives, and sometimes it’s often not practical for us to do the things we’d like to do. Like it’s not practical for me to move back to the US just so I can protest about climate change. 

So what can I do from abroad? I’m more than happy to protest when I’m back in the states to visit. But besides that? What can I do? Are there good charities I could donate to that might actually make a difference? Are there organizations I can join where I can put some time and money in to help? Is there anything else that I can do to help that I might just not be thinking of? Should I write my congressman or congresswoman? Would that do any good, especially since my US residency is in an already very liberal place? 

I would love any suggestions anyone could give me.",1,"I want to do more. What can I do? I personally believe that the only solution to climate change is massive institutional change on a governmental level. If the governments of the world act as if this is the dire situation that it really is, we can mitigate the damage before it’s too late. We need to hold our politicians and governments accountable, and we all need to do a lot more to force change in the US (I single out the US because I’m American). I read about mass protests and student walk outs in Europe, and I wonder why this isn’t happening in the US.

I know it’s important that we all do our part, plant trees, recycle, etc.  but the little things that we can do on a daily basis are not enough. It makes me sick that people are not rising up and demanding action now...  but sadly, I am also one of those who is talking the talk but not walking the walk.

I’m an American living in Asia. I have a life here, and I don’t know when I’ll be coming back to the US to live. I’m not really in a position to be organizing protests in the country that I live in... and I live in a big city where I can’t plant trees.

Is the public properly educated on climate change?,I feel like the term global warming does not adequately convey our environmental problems.  It can be confusing and open to interpretation for deniers. Show a graph of atmospheric co2 concentrations and that cannot be disputed.  It also seems to me that many people don’t understand the carbon cycle.  I myself have a lot to learn about the subject and I think the public needs to be better educated so that we can become more united in a goal towards carbon neutrality.,1,Is the public properly educated on climate change?

Electric Arc carbon sequestration via renewable sorces? An interesting patent has expired.,"I just learned that as of 04/25/2019 (yesterday) the pattent on a technology that uses electrical arc to bust apart CO2 back into O2, O3, and Carbon just became public domain. https://patents.google.com/patent/US3113086A/en

I imagine that this could be hooked up to wind turbines and other renewables to create carbon capture stations. I wonder how large something like this could be scaled up. Carbon separation from CO2 is much more effective under exposure to UV light so I'd be curious to know if the chamber which contains the  electrical arc could be exposed to sunlight somehow (bubble of transparent material that doesn't impede UV, possibly glass?) if carbon sequestration yield could be increased? (https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2003/03/030320073502.htm)

The thing about electricity is that even after arcing, it still exists and needs to ground. In theory this system could simply be a relay on a path to utilization of the same electricity for consumer purposes.

I'm interested in informing a climate skeptic. Any suggestions?,"Hi all,

I'm an environmental science student and my bf recently told me about a weird interaction he had with a friend. His friend said he believes climate change is a hoax, mainly based on information he's gotten from a guy named Dan Peña, who endorses Donald Trump and appears to have some kind of vested interests in supporting the longevity of the fossil fuel industry and lobbying against the development of clean energy (though I haven't found anything directly tying him to it at this point).

I'm looking for good material that debunks Peña's outlandish claims about the ""climate change hoax"", but I can't seem to find any videos of direct responses to Peña's claims that would be easily understood by someone with little understanding of climate science. I find that showing skeptics research papers and statistics never really changes their views, so I want to try an approach that would work better for this type of person. 

Can anyone point me in the direction of some interesting, stimulating, maybe funny videos that debate climate skeptics, that I can use to sway this denier to see the evidence instead of just making him feel overwhelmed/belittled by dumping a bunch of statistics on him? Also, if anyone can help me find any evidence that points out possible conflicts of interest between Dan Peña and his vehement climate change denial, that would be very helpful!

Sceptical of climate models,"After having read some Ipcc reports, if seems that much of the ""proof"" for the postulated high climate sensitivity to co2 hinges on parameter studies of climate models to temperature data going back only to the start of satellite records around 1978.

Having worked with fitting simulators to online data professionally, the climate model approach irks me on many levels. 

1. there is no clear separation between tuninig and validation datasets. 

2. gisp2 data going back 10000 years indicate that the dominant natural climate cycle having a 1000 year period, fitting of models should ideally be to at least one full period, so 1000 years, not 50 years of data.

3. if the recent 50 years have been part of a natural warming cycle, models which do not describe the 1000 year cycle in its structure will when tuned to data of recent warming inadvertently have parameters that are ""colored"" to favor warming.

4. models seem too complex when the aim is to study the relation between gmt and co2, when there is essentially one model output and a handful of significant inputs, a 3D model whose code fills 18000 pages likely is overparametrized, which may give poorer prediction capabilities than a model with fewer parameters in general.

5. Climate models are surprisingly not automatically tuned (probably because they are too complex) This is a big red flag if true. 

6. Researchers know that models have structural errors, i. e. important observed phenomena are not described correctly, such as cloud formation, yet the model is still used as basis for policy.

7. Backtesting of data is often neglected, or the implication of poor backtest performance is not appreciated
8. A general disinterest in paleoclimate because models are too complex to backtest against sparse proxy data (then maybe your model is too complex?) 


Personally I would very much like to see much simpler lumped (1D) models attempt to describe co2 and temperature proxy data for the last 10000 years, and see what co2 sensitivity such models find,I would actually trust the predictions of such a model far more than the pseudoscience of current climate models. Anyone aware of any such studies? 

I would trust more a 3D-climate model that were able to describe natural variability in paleoclimate temperature proxies. Anyone aware of any such studies? 

Ideally I would appreciate an open discussion with someone knowledgeable in the field, but I fear that practicioners are too invested in their method to be able to review it critically, and that anyone not working in the field will be subject to gatekeeping.

The British perspective.,"How the BBC exaggerate man-made global warming in the David Attenborough propaganda program!!

Even the IPCC admits that man-made warming in the last 70 years is only 0.3° C !!!!



Last year, the BBC issued guidelines instructing editors that inviting comment from ‘climate change deniers’ was ‘false balance’. In practice, this has meant that those who accept climate change is real, but less threatening than some such as Attenborough claim, have effectively been banished from the airwaves.
Now the Corporation has given acres of airtime to protesters demanding the overthrow of democratic governments and an almost immediate end to fossil fuel-derived power, heating and transport – in other words, the abrupt termination of civilisation as we know it.
Thunberg has become a global media darling, her pronouncements cherished as if they were holy writ. 
‘I want you all to panic,’ she told the Davos economic forum in January: and Attenborough’s film may well have persuaded viewers to do just that – and, perhaps, to join the Extinction Rebellion barricades. 

Watching it did fill me with horror, but not at the threat from global warming. It was at the way Sir David and the BBC presented a picture of the near future which was so much more frightening than is justified.
Climate science remains a field riven by deep uncertainties. The film largely glossed over these – and where faced with alternatives, it plumped unerringly for the most pessimistic version of the ‘truth’.
Let me be clear: I am not a ‘denier’. Global warming and climate change are real, in large measure caused by humans. According to the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), our emissions were responsible for more than half the 0.6C – 0.7C global average temperature rise recorded between 1951 and 2010.
But I am also convinced that the ‘panic’ Thunberg desires and Attenborough’s film will encourage is not helpful when it comes to making policy designed to tackle it. Moreover, it is a grotesque travesty of the truth to claim that ‘nothing’ has been done: for example, since 1990, UK emissions have fallen by 43 per cent, according to the Government’s Committee on Climate Change. Not only that, Government statistics say 56 per cent of our electricity came from low carbon sources in 2018, our last coal-fired power station will close in six years and the Government has pledged to ‘decarbonise’ electricity by 2030.
Above all, the Climate Change Act requires Britain to reduce its 1990 carbon emissions by no less than 80 per cent by the year 2050, making us the first major economy to make such a dramatic commitment. To say that ‘nothing’ has been done is as risible as it is dishonest.

The IPCC, regarded by mainstream scientists as the world’s most authoritative source, says there have been some changes, such as higher rainfall. But its Fifth Assessment Report, published in 2013, stated there are ‘no significant observed trends in global tropical cyclone frequency over the past century’. It added: ‘No robust trends in annual numbers of tropical storms, hurricanes and major hurricane counts have been identified over the past 100 years in the North Atlantic basin.’
A separate IPCC report last year said that cyclones in the tropics would in future be less numerous, although some would be stronger.
In 2014, a group of IPCC experts published a paper about flooding. So far, they said, ‘no gauge-based evidence has been found for a climate-driven, globally widespread change in the magnitude/frequency of floods.’
Another memorable segment of the film showed a father and son narrowly escaping from one of several devastating fires last year in California. These, too, were ascribed to global warming. Surprisingly, several recent scientific papers suggest that wildfires have been declining in recent years – even in California, where statistics gathered by the local agency, Calfires, says the number across the state has roughly halved since 1987, following a peak in the 1970s.
According to a study published by the Royal Society in 2016, ‘many consider wildfire as an accelerating problem’. In reality, however, says the study: ‘global area burned appears to have declined in past decades, and there is increasing evidence that there is less fire in the global landscape than centuries ago.’",0,"The British perspective.

Moreover, it is a grotesque travesty of the truth to claim that ‘nothing’ has been done: for example, since 1990, UK emissions have fallen by 43 per cent, according to the Government’s Committee on Climate Change. Not only that, Government statistics say 56 per cent of our electricity came from low carbon sources in 2018, our last coal-fired power station will close in six years and the Government has pledged to ‘decarbonise’ electricity by 2030.
Above all, the Climate Change Act requires Britain to reduce its 1990 carbon emissions by no less than 80 per cent by the year 2050, making us the first major economy to make such a dramatic commitment. To say that ‘nothing’ has been done is as risible as it is dishonest.

The IPCC, regarded by mainstream scientists as the world’s most authoritative source, says there have been some changes, such as higher rainfall. But its Fifth Assessment Report, published in 2013, stated there are ‘no significant observed trends in global tropical cyclone frequency over the past century’. It added: ‘No robust trends in annual numbers of tropical storms, hurricanes and major hurricane counts have been identified over the past 100 years in the North Atlantic basin.’
A separate IPCC report last year said that cyclones in the tropics would in future be less numerous, although some would be stronger.
In 2014, a group of IPCC experts published a paper about flooding. So far, they said, ‘no gauge-based evidence has been found for a climate-driven, globally widespread change in the magnitude/frequency of floods.’
Another memorable segment of the film showed a father and son narrowly escaping from one of several devastating fires last year in California. These, too, were ascribed to global warming. Surprisingly, several recent scientific papers suggest that wildfires have been declining in recent years – even in California, where statistics gathered by the local agency, Calfires, says the number across the state has roughly halved since 1987, following a peak in the 1970s.
According to a study published by the Royal Society in 2016, ‘many consider wildfire as an accelerating problem’. In reality, however, says the study: ‘global area burned appears to have declined in past decades, and there is increasing evidence that there is less fire in the global landscape than centuries ago.’"

"""Climate Change"" is Bullshit. Human CO2 Emissions Have Little Effect on Atmospheric CO2"," 

The United Nations *Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change*   (IPCC) agrees human CO2 is only (approximately) 5 percent and natural  CO2 is 95 percent of the CO2 inflow into the atmosphere. The ratio of  human to natural CO2 in the atmosphere must equal the ratio of the  inflows. Yet IPCC claims human CO2 has caused all the rise in  atmospheric CO2 above 280 ppm, which is now 130 ppm or 32 percent of  today’s atmospheric CO2.

To cause the  human 5 percent to become 32 percent in the atmosphere,  the IPCC model  treats human and natural CO2 differently, which is impossible because  the molecules are identical. IPCC’s Bern model artificially traps human  CO2 in the atmosphere while it lets natural CO2 flow freely out of the  atmosphere.

By contrast, a simple  Physics Model treats all CO2 molecules the same, as it should, and shows  how CO2 flows through the atmosphere and produces a balance level where  outflow equals inflow. Thereafter, if inflow is constant, level remains  constant.

The Physics Model has only  one hypothesis, that outflow is proportional to level. The Physics Model  exactly replicates the 14C data from 1970 to 2014 with only two  physical parameters: balance level and e-time. The 14C data trace how  CO2 flows out of the atmosphere.

The  Physics Model shows the 14CO2 e-time is a constant 16.5 years. Other  data show e-time for 12CO2 is about 4 to 5 years. IPCC claims human CO2  reduces ocean buffer capacity. But that would increase e-time. The  constant e-time proves IPCC’s claim is false.

IPCC  argues that the human-caused reduction of 14C and 13C in the   atmosphere prove human CO2 causes all the increase in atmospheric CO2.   However, numbers show these isotope data support the Physics Model and   reject the IPCC model.

The Physics  Model shows how inflows of human and natural CO2 into the  atmosphere  set balance levels proportional to their inflows. Each balance level  remains constant if its inflow remains constant. Continued constant CO2  emissions do not add more CO2 to the atmosphere. No CO2 accumulates in  the atmosphere.

Present human CO2  inflow produces a balance level of about 18 ppm. Present natural CO2  inflow produces a balance level of about 392 ppm. Human CO2 is  insignificant to the increase of CO2 in the atmosphere.  Increased  natural CO2 inflow has increased the level of CO2 in the  atmosphere.

The Climate Change Agenda,"We all know that trying to connect anything to the Climate Change Agenda that has to do with power grabs or depopulation is just a wacky conspiracy theory, but hear me out and let's take a little walk on the wild side......

Every  day, in meetings at all levels of government, representatives of Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), planning groups, and federal agents surround elected representatives and insist that their policies have nothing to do with international agendas. They regularly publish reports and rail against anyone even mentioning the names Agenda 21 or the new Agenda 2030. “No, no, no,” they insist. “Those people are just  crazy conspiracy theorists. Ours is just a local plan for our community.”

Elected Representatives are often confused. Issues and policies suddenly appear in front of them with sample, ready-made  legislation. And then the unending pressure begins for them to pass it. There is confusion, uncertainty and there is the herd mentality to pass legislation. And it’s passed without knowledge of its origins, its  purpose, and especially a lack of understanding of its consequences.  

What most of these legislators fail to understand is the direct  relationship much of this legislation has with a much larger agenda.  Most legislation interconnects with other pieces and parts contained in other legislation. 

&amp;#x200B;

### I. Global Warming/Climate Change

It has been so discredited in the true scientific community that proponents have become almost hysterical in their continued attempts to enforce Climate Change policy. Most recently the Justice Department is considering legal action against “deniers.”  Why don’t they stop, even to question if their science is sound? They instead use great energy to attack any scientist who does dare ask questions or finds data contrary to the “official” line. Why is it so vitally important that they  continue to promote something that clearly is, to say the least, questionable?

It’s because all of Agenda 21 policy is built on the premise that man is  destroying the Earth. Climate Change is their “proof.” To eliminate that premise is to remove all credibility and purpose for their entire agenda. They are willing to go to any length, even lies, to keep the climate change foot on our throats.

On the local level this translates into planning policy that controls energy use and the efforts to cut down on the use of cars, enforcement of the building of  expensive light rail train systems and bike paths and installation of smart meters, etc.

But don’t take my word for it. I’ll let them speak for themselves:

**“No matter if the science of global warming is all phony…climate change  provides the greatest opportunity to bring about justice and equality in the world.”** ***Christine Stewart (Former Canadian Minister of the Environment)*** 

**“We’ve got to ride this global warming issue. Even if the theory of global  warming is wrong, we will be doing the right thing in terms of economic  and environmental policy.”** ***Timothy Wirth (President, UN Foundation)***

**“It doesn’t matter what is true. It only matters what people believe is true.”** ***Paul Watson (Co-Founder of Green Peace.)***

### II. Fear of over population

Fear is the central driving force behind nearly every Sustainable policy initiative. It’s the real force behind Stack and Pack Smart Growth cities.

The fact is, in developed nations populations are actually going down. The only real growth in the US population in recent years has been from immigration, legal or otherwise. Open border immigration policy is actually implementation of Agenda 21 as part of the drive to destroy national sovereignty and “nation states.”

Environmentalists insist that the borders must be open to allow as many to immigrate here as possible. They argue that the U.S. has a greater ability to control them and protect the environment than if we left them in third world  countries. That’s because the Greens already have a stranglehold over our nation’s industry through massive environmental regulations.

In the face of their fear of overpopulation, however, studies have shown that there is no world wide over population crisis. In fact one study insists that we could put the entire population of the world in an area the size of Texas with a population density of Paris, France. Over population, and its accompanying environmental degradation, is a problem primarily in countries where the poor are deprived by government to improve their conditions. Nations that refuse to legalize private property ownership for the masses, for example, are a primary reason for growing poverty.

Meanwhile, Sustainablists work to keep these nations from developing or increasing energy use, thereby keeping them poor. Green regulations stop the building of infrastructure. They panic at the idea of increased energy use in developing nations. Instead of  working to solve the real problems—the root of poverty- they exploit the excuse of over population and advocate enforcing polices to drastically reduce populations. China’s brutal one child policy of forced abortions and sterilization has become their model.

Do you think I’m joking? Then consider these quotes from the Sustainablists:

**“Childbearing should be a punishable crime against society, unless the parents hold a government license. All potential parents should be required to use contraceptive chemicals, the government issuing antidotes to citizens chosen for childbearing.”** ***David Brower (Sierra Club)***

**“A reasonable estimate for an industrialized world society at the present  North American material standard of living would be 1 billion. At a more  frugal European standard of living, 2 to 3 billion would be possible.”** ***United Nations Global Biodiversity Assessment.***

### III. The destruction of the free market system.

We have heard statement after statement from the UN; from members of  Congress; the news media; and from Hollywood, all deriding the free market system as evil, corrupt and a tool of the rich to hold down the poor. So now, after deciding that the poor are expendable for the sake of stopping overpopulation, suddenly the planners are worried about them—if it leads to their ability to raid our bank accounts. So are they  really worried about protecting the environment—or are they actually honoring the tactics of Jesse James?

Redistribution of wealth is  behind every policy that comes out of the UN, and looking back at the Obama Administration as well. The EPA is the attack dog to shut down entire industries like coal. It has become very difficult to operate a  manufacturing business in the US, and nearly impossible to start a new one. Environmental protection is always the excuse. 

At the UN’s Rio + 20 Summit held in 2012, **the idea of “Zero Economic Growth” was  advocated** \- just to keep things fair. It was stated that even the  building of new roads upsets the status quo and disrupts a well ordered society. Such idiotic ideas are the driving force behind Sustainable Development. Again, images of the Dark Ages come to mind.

Yet,  consider “local” planning programs that cut off access roads, and again,  discourage cars. What about the EPA’s war on industry. Pretty hard to have economic growth without industry. The timber industry is killed and  communities die. Dams are torn down and farmers disappear. Zero Economic Growth in the making. Just local?

Again, not my words, let them tell you themselves:

**“We must make this an insecure and inhospitable place for capitalists and  their projects. We must reclaim the roads and plowed lands, halt dam  construction, tear down existing dams, free shackled rivers and return to wilderness millions of acres of presently settled land.”** ***Dave Foreman, (Earth First).***

**“Global sustainability requires the deliberate quest of poverty, reduced  resource consumption and set levels of mortality control”** ***Professor Maurice King (Population Control Advocate)***

**“We believe planning should be a tool for allocating resources…and  eliminating the great inequalities of wealth and power in our society…  because the free market has proven itself incapable of doing this.”** [*Plannersnetwork.org*](http://plannersnetwork.org/) ***Statement of Principles. the American Planning Association is a member and supporter of these principles.***  

### IV. Cheap Energy is the enemy of the Earth.

To the average person the drive to stop any ability to obtain cheap energy  makes no sense. People are hurting economically. Jobs are lost. Energy costs are skyrocketing. Any attempt to drill oil, fracking of shale gas, and mining coal are all vigorously blocked by government and green policy. Yet the government spends billions of dollars on “alternative  energy” such as wind and solar, which provides less than 3% of our energy needs. Why? What is the motivation to put such shackles on the US economic engine? The excuse is that energy use drives up CO2 emissions and accelerates global warming - the excuse necessary to “harmonize” the  US into the socialist, Sustainable global noose.

Many current state and local policies now are moving to increase taxes at the gas  pump to keep energy costs high. As the prices rise the “planners”  will insist that the only solution is to enforce the building of expensive public transportation.

But, according to some anti-energy advocates, the fear of cheap energy goes beyond environmental protection - energy availability helps build wealth for  individuals and removes them from the rolls of the dependent—the  opposite goal of sustainable policy.

**“Giving society cheap, abundant energy is the worst thing that could ever happen to the planet.”** ***Prof. Paul Ehrlich (Professor of Population Studies, Stanford University).***

**“Complex technology of any sort is an assault on human dignity. It would be  little short of disastrous for us to discover a source of clean, cheap,  abundant energy, because of what we might do with it.”** ***Amory Lovins (Rocky Mountain Institute).***  

**“The prospect of cheap fusion energy is the worst thing that could happen to the planet.”** ***Jeremy Rifkin (Greenhouse Crisis Foundation).***

Ours is just a local plan for our community.”

Elected Representatives are often confused. Issues and policies suddenly appear in front of them with sample, ready-made  legislation. And then the unending pressure begins for them to pass it. There is confusion, uncertainty and there is the herd mentality to pass legislation. And it’s passed without knowledge of its origins, its  purpose, and especially a lack of understanding of its consequences.  

What most of these legislators fail to understand is the direct  relationship much of this legislation has with a much larger agenda.  Most legislation interconnects with other pieces and parts contained in other legislation. 

&amp;#x200B;

### I. Global Warming/Climate Change

It has been so discredited in the true scientific community that proponents have become almost hysterical in their continued attempts to enforce Climate Change policy. Most recently the Justice Department is considering legal action against “deniers.”  Why don’t they stop, even to question if their science is sound? They instead use great energy to attack any scientist who does dare ask questions or finds data contrary to the “official” line. Why is it so vitally important that they  continue to promote something that clearly is, to say the least, questionable?

It’s because all of Agenda 21 policy is built on the premise that man is  destroying the Earth. Climate Change is their “proof.” To eliminate that premise is to remove all credibility and purpose for their entire agenda. They are willing to go to any length, even lies, to keep the climate change foot on our throats.

On the local level this translates into planning policy that controls energy use and the efforts to cut down on the use of cars, enforcement of the building of  expensive light rail train systems and bike paths and installation of smart meters, etc.

But don’t take my word for it. I’ll let them speak for themselves:

**“No matter if the science of global warming is all phony…climate change  provides the greatest opportunity to bring about justice and equality in the world.”** ***Christine Stewart (Former Canadian Minister of the Environment)*** 

**“We’ve got to ride this global warming issue. Even if the theory of global  warming is wrong, we will be doing the right thing in terms of economic  and environmental policy.”** ***Timothy Wirth (President, UN Foundation)***

**“It doesn’t matter what is true. It only matters what people believe is true.”** ***Paul Watson (Co-Founder of Green Peace.)***

### II. Fear of over population

Fear is the central driving force behind nearly every Sustainable policy initiative. It’s the real force behind Stack and Pack Smart Growth cities.

The fact is, in developed nations populations are actually going down. The only real growth in the US population in recent years has been from immigration, legal or otherwise. Open border immigration policy is actually implementation of Agenda 21 as part of the drive to destroy national sovereignty and “nation states.”

Environmentalists insist that the borders must be open to allow as many to immigrate here as possible. They argue that the U.S. has a greater ability to control them and protect the environment than if we left them in third world  countries. That’s because the Greens already have a stranglehold over our nation’s industry through massive environmental regulations.

In the face of their fear of overpopulation, however, studies have shown that there is no world wide over population crisis. In fact one study insists that we could put the entire population of the world in an area the size of Texas with a population density of Paris, France. Over population, and its accompanying environmental degradation, is a problem primarily in countries where the poor are deprived by government to improve their conditions. Nations that refuse to legalize private property ownership for the masses, for example, are a primary reason for growing poverty.

Meanwhile, Sustainablists work to keep these nations from developing or increasing energy use, thereby keeping them poor. Green regulations stop the building of infrastructure. They panic at the idea of increased energy use in developing nations. Instead of  working to solve the real problems—the root of poverty- they exploit the excuse of over population and advocate enforcing polices to drastically reduce populations. China’s brutal one child policy of forced abortions and sterilization has become their model.

Do you think I’m joking? Then consider these quotes from the Sustainablists:

**“Childbearing should be a punishable crime against society, unless the parents hold a government license. All potential parents should be required to use contraceptive chemicals, the government issuing antidotes to citizens chosen for childbearing.”** ***David Brower (Sierra Club)***

**“A reasonable estimate for an industrialized world society at the present  North American material standard of living would be 1 billion. At a more  frugal European standard of living, 2 to 3 billion would be possible.”** ***United Nations Global Biodiversity Assessment.***

### III. The destruction of the free market system.

We have heard statement after statement from the UN; from members of  Congress; the news media; and from Hollywood, all deriding the free market system as evil, corrupt and a tool of the rich to hold down the poor. So now, after deciding that the poor are expendable for the sake of stopping overpopulation, suddenly the planners are worried about them—if it leads to their ability to raid our bank accounts. So are they  really worried about protecting the environment—or are they actually honoring the tactics of Jesse James?

Redistribution of wealth is  behind every policy that comes out of the UN, and looking back at the Obama Administration as well. The EPA is the attack dog to shut down entire industries like coal. It has become very difficult to operate a  manufacturing business in the US, and nearly impossible to start a new one. Environmental protection is always the excuse. 

At the UN’s Rio + 20 Summit held in 2012, **the idea of “Zero Economic Growth” was  advocated** \- just to keep things fair. It was stated that even the  building of new roads upsets the status quo and disrupts a well ordered society. Such idiotic ideas are the driving force behind Sustainable Development. Again, images of the Dark Ages come to mind.

Yet,  consider “local” planning programs that cut off access roads, and again,  discourage cars. What about the EPA’s war on industry. Pretty hard to have economic growth without industry. The timber industry is killed and  communities die. Dams are torn down and farmers disappear. Zero Economic Growth in the making. Just local?

Again, not my words, let them tell you themselves:

**“We must make this an insecure and inhospitable place for capitalists and  their projects. We must reclaim the roads and plowed lands, halt dam  construction, tear down existing dams, free shackled rivers and return to wilderness millions of acres of presently settled land.”** ***Dave Foreman, (Earth First).***

**“Global sustainability requires the deliberate quest of poverty, reduced  resource consumption and set levels of mortality control”** ***Professor Maurice King (Population Control Advocate)***

**“We believe planning should be a tool for allocating resources…and  eliminating the great inequalities of wealth and power in our society…  because the free market has proven itself incapable of doing this.”** [*Plannersnetwork.org*](http://plannersnetwork.org/) ***Statement of Principles. the American Planning Association is a member and supporter of these principles.***  

### IV. Cheap Energy is the enemy of the Earth.

To the average person the drive to stop any ability to obtain cheap energy  makes no sense. People are hurting economically. Jobs are lost. Energy costs are skyrocketing. Any attempt to drill oil, fracking of shale gas, and mining coal are all vigorously blocked by government and green policy. Yet the government spends billions of dollars on “alternative  energy” such as wind and solar, which provides less than 3% of our energy needs. Why? What is the motivation to put such shackles on the US economic engine? The excuse is that energy use drives up CO2 emissions and accelerates global warming - the excuse necessary to “harmonize” the  US into the socialist, Sustainable global noose.

Many current state and local policies now are moving to increase taxes at the gas  pump to keep energy costs high. As the prices rise the “planners”  will insist that the only solution is to enforce the building of expensive public transportation.

But, according to some anti-energy advocates, the fear of cheap energy goes beyond environmental protection - energy availability helps build wealth for  individuals and removes them from the rolls of the dependent—the  opposite goal of sustainable policy.

**“Giving society cheap, abundant energy is the worst thing that could ever happen to the planet.”** ***Prof. Paul Ehrlich (Professor of Population Studies, Stanford University).***

**“Complex technology of any sort is an assault on human dignity. It would be  little short of disastrous for us to discover a source of clean, cheap,  abundant energy, because of what we might do with it.”** ***Amory Lovins (Rocky Mountain Institute).***  

**“The prospect of cheap fusion energy is the worst thing that could happen to the planet.”** ***Jeremy Rifkin (Greenhouse Crisis Foundation).***

Alternative theory to explain global warming. No debunk so far,"Humans consume 10 million gigatons of water each year. 70% of that is used to water  plants in agriculture (1). The water on the fields has 3 ways to go:
 - sinking deep into lower levels of the soil 
 - evaporate 
 - being absorbed by the plants (what also eventually leads to evaporation, because plants evaporate water over the leaves)

Actually farmers try to increase field water efficiency (fraction of water used by plants to total water used) but let’s say only 10% evaporate. That means 700 000 gigatons of water evaporate each year. Most of it by Irrigation. Rivers are redirected and spread over huge agricultural areas. On that area the sun developes enough energy to evaporate the water while it would just run into  the ocean without human influence. So we are basically evaporating rivers all over the world. And that is much more efficient than digging for coal and burn it.

But what about rain? Water doesn’t stay in the atmosphere!

Yes, and that’s why many reliable sources claim human couldn’t influence water content in the atmosphere. Because it comes down again, it can’t increase, can it? Yes of course it can. The numbers of airplanes in the air is increasing even though they don’t stuck in the air. Around 16000 planes are in the air right now (2019) and this number is going to increase. Around 200000 takeoffs  every day, which means around 8000 take offs per hour. An average flight duration of 2 hours means, that when you take off, 16 000 other planes take off before you land. And if you increase the take offs per hour you will have more planes in the air, even if the average duration remains at 2 hours.
So the same thing with water. Water remains about 10 days in the atmosphere (2). As mentioned earlier, 700 000 gigatons are evaporated each year. That means 2000 gigatons per day. So within the 10 day lifetime of water 20 000 gigatons are  evaporated due to human influences. Compared to CO2 we emit 30 gigatons each year. according to the simple calculation above we increased the water content much more than we increased CO2. And that while H2O is a much more potent greenhouse gas than CO2. That would mean water vapor is the main cause of global warming!

Why can’t we measure the increase of water?

A gas needs around 1 year to reach each part of the atmosphere and even longer to be homogeneously mixed in the atmosphere. Since the lifetime of CO2 is so large, it actually is almost homogeneously mixed in the atmosphere. That means if you measure CO2 in only one spot, you know the content on alle other spots, because it’s the same.
H20 however has a short life time. The water content varies extremely in different location. When you see clouds, the water content is higher in the cloud than right next to it. You would need an infinite amount of measure spots to estimate the global water content in the atmosphere. Secondly the water content is around 2%. 2.43% or 2.44% is an increase by less than 1%. But for CO2 a difference between 0,03 and 0,04 is significant enough to be measured.

But we can’t add water to the atmosphere!

I never understood this argument. Ever hang out wet laundry? It dries in the sun. The water doesn’t disappear, it evaporates and is in the atmosphere. If the relative humidity (RH) was 100% the clothes wouldn’t dry. Sweating would be inefficient and you would have fog. At 100% RH you need to heat the air in order to take up more water. However when RH is below 100% it can take up more water. That’s the definition of RH. And as we observe in daily life, 100% RH is not common on surface altitude. That’s how sweating works, water is evaporating from the skin to cool the skin. And that’s possible without heating up the air, otherwise evolution wouldn’t have given us the ability to sweat.

Possible mistakes/errors

* most trivial would be a failed conversion between gigatons, cubic meter, kg etc.. because we are talking about millions of gigatons it’s possible. I think I did it right but maybe double check.
* error in the basic concept: maybe I overlooked something. Most likely the point why humans can’t add water to atmosphere. Many sources claim we have to heat up the air to increase water content. But I don’t understand why. I think it would be true at 100%RH but below we can ofcourse evaporate water as we observe in daily life. In Chile millions of liter of water are pumped to the surface and evaporated by the sun because in the remaining salt Lithium can be found. I think I gave enough example why I think we actually can evaporate water. The claim we can’t sounds so stupid to me, I don’t know why everyone says that.
* some more complex phenomenon is involved. Maybe water evaporated from agriculture has a different life time. A few hours would be enough though. The amount of water evaporation is so much higher than the CO2... Also i don’t see why water vapor from humans would behave different than natural vapor. We are basically just wetting the earths surface. Then the sun does the rest in natural processes.

&amp;#x200B;

**Imagine that there is a new scientific theory that warns of an impending crisis, and points to a way out.**

This theory quickly draws support from leading scientists, politicians and celebrities around the world. Research is funded by distinguished philanthropies, and carried out at prestigious universities. The crisis is reported frequently in the media. The science is taught in college and high school classrooms.

I don’t mean global warming. I’m talking about another theory, which rose to prominence a century ago.

Its supporters included Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, and Winston Churchill. It was approved by Supreme Court justices Oliver Wendell Holmes and Louis Brandeis, who ruled in its favor. The famous names who supported it included Alexander Graham Bell, inventor of the telephone; activist Margaret Sanger; botanist Luther Burbank; Leland Stanford, founder of Stanford University; the novelist H. G. Wells; the playwright George Bernard Shaw; and hundreds of others. Nobel Prize winners gave support. Research was backed by the Carnegie and Rockefeller Foundations. The Cold Springs Harbor Institute was built to carry out this research, but important work was also done at Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Stanford and Johns Hopkins. Legislation to address the crisis was passed in states from New York to California.

These efforts had the support of the National Academy of Sciences, the American Medical Association, and the National Research Council. It was said that if Jesus were alive, he would have supported this effort.

All in all, the research, legislation and molding of public opinion surrounding the theory went on for almost half a century. Those who opposed the theory were shouted down and called reactionary, blind to reality, or just plain ignorant. But in hindsight, what is surprising is that so few people objected.

Today, we know that this famous theory that gained so much support was actually pseudoscience. The crisis it claimed was nonexistent. And the actions taken in the name of theory were morally and criminally wrong. Ultimately, they led to the deaths of millions of people.

**The theory was eugenics, and its history is so dreadful — and, to those who were caught up in it, so embarrassing — that it is now rarely discussed. But it is a story that should be well know to every citizen, so that its horrors are not repeated.**

The theory of eugenics postulated a crisis of the gene pool leading to the deterioration of the human race. The best human beings were not breeding as rapidly as the inferior ones — the foreigners, immigrants, Jews, degenerates, the unfit, and the “feeble minded.” Francis Galton, a respected British scientist, first speculated about this area, but his ideas were taken far beyond anything he intended. They were adopted by science-minded Americans, as well as those who had no interest in science but who were worried about the immigration of inferior races early in the twentieth century — “dangerous human pests” who represented “the rising tide of imbeciles” and who were polluting the best of the human race.

The eugenicists and the immigrationists joined forces to put a stop to this. The plan was to identify individuals who were feeble-minded — Jews were agreed to be largely feeble-minded, but so were many foreigners, as well as blacks — and stop them from breeding by isolation in institutions or by sterilization.

As Margaret Sanger said, “Fostering the good-for-nothing at the expense of the good is an extreme cruelty … there is not greater curse to posterity than that of bequeathing them an increasing population of imbeciles.” She spoke of the burden of caring for “this dead weight of human waste.”

Such views were widely shared. H.G. Wells spoke against “ill-trained swarms of inferior citizens.” Theodore Roosevelt said that “Society has no business to permit degenerates to reproduce their kind.” Luther Burbank” “Stop permitting criminals and weaklings to reproduce.” George Bernard Shaw said that only eugenics could save mankind.

There was overt racism in this movement, exemplified by texts such as “The Rising Tide of Color Against White World Supremacy” by American author Lothrop Stoddard. But, at the time, racism was considered an unremarkable aspect of the effort to attain a marvelous goal — the improvement of humankind in the future. It was this avant-garde notion that attracted the most liberal and progressive minds of a generation. California was one of twenty-nine American states to pass laws allowing sterilization, but it proved the most-forward-looking and enthusiastic — more sterilizations were carried out in California than anywhere else in America.

Eugenics research was funded by the Carnegie Foundation, and later by the Rockefeller Foundation. The latter was so enthusiastic that even after the center of the eugenics effort moved to Germany, and involved the gassing of individuals from mental institutions, the Rockefeller Foundation continued to finance German researchers at a very high level. (The foundation was quiet about it, but they were still funding research in 1939, only months before the onset of World War II.)

Since the 1920s, American eugenicists had been jealous because the Germans had taken leadership of the movement away from them. The Germans were admirably progressive. They set up ordinary-looking houses where “mental defectives” were brought and interviewed one at a time, before being led into a back room, which was, in fact, a gas chamber. There, they were gassed with carbon monoxide, and their bodies disposed of in a crematorium located on the property.

Eventually, this program was expanded into a vast network of concentration camps located near railroad lines, enabling the efficient transport and of killing of 'undesirables'.

After World War II, nobody was a eugenicist, and nobody had ever been a eugenicist. Biographers of the celebrated and the powerful did not dwell on the attractions of this philosophy to their subjects, and sometimes did not mention it at all. Eugenics ceased to be a subject for college classrooms, although some argue that its ideas continue to have currency in disguised form.

But in retrospect, three points stand out. First, despite the construction of Cold Springs Harbor Laboratory, despite the efforts of universities and the pleadings of lawyers, there was no scientific basis for eugenics. In fact, nobody at that time knew what a gene really was. The movement was able to proceed because it employed vague terms never rigorously defined. “Feeble-mindedness” could mean anything from poverty to illiteracy to epilepsy. Similarly, there was no clear definition of “degenerate” or “unfit.”

Second, the eugenics movement was really a social program masquerading as a scientific one. What drove it was concern about immigration and racism and undesirable people moving into one’s neighborhood or country. Once again, vague terminology helped conceal what was really going on.

Third, and most distressing, the scientific establishment in both the United States and Germany did not mount any sustained protest. Quite the contrary. In Germany scientists quickly fell into line with the program. Modern German researchers have gone back to review Nazi documents from the 1930s. They expected to find directives telling scientists what research should be done. But none were necessary. In the words of Ute Deichman, “Scientists, including those who were not members of the \[Nazi\] party, helped to get funding for their work through their modified behavior and direct cooperation with the state.” Deichman speaks of the “active role of scientists themselves in regard to Nazi race policy … where \[research\] was aimed at confirming the racial doctrine … no external pressure can be documented.” German scientists adjusted their research interests to the new policies. And those few who did not adjust disappeared.

A second example of politicized science is quite different in character, but it exemplifies the hazard of government ideology controlling the work of science, and of uncritical media promoting false concepts. Trofim Denisovich Lysenko was a self-promoting peasant who, it was said, “solved the problem of fertilizing the fields without fertilizers and minerals.” In 1928 he claimed to have invented a procedure called vernalization, by which seeds were moistened and chilled to enhance the later growth of crops.

Lysenko’s methods never faced a rigorous test, but his claim that his treated seeds passed on their characteristics to the next generation represented a revival of Lamarckian ideas at a time when the rest of the world was embracing Mendelian genetics. Josef Stalin was drawn to Lamarckian ideas, which implied a future unbounded by hereditary constraints; he also wanted improved agricultural production. Lysenko promised both, and became the darling of a Soviet media that was on the lookout for stories about clever peasants who had developed revolutionary procedures.

Lysenko was portrayed as a genius, and he milked his celebrity for all it was worth. He was especially skillful at denouncing this opponents. He used questionnaires from farmers to prove that vernalization increased crop yields, and thus avoided any direct tests. Carried on a wave of state-sponsored enthusiasm, his rise was rapid. By 1937, he was a member of the Supreme Soviet.

By then, Lysenko and his theories dominated Russian biology. The result was famines that killed millions, and purges that sent hundreds of dissenting Soviet scientists to the gulags or the firing squads. Lysenko was aggressive in attacking genetics, which was finally banned as “bourgeois pseudoscience” in 1948. There was never any basis for Lysenko’s ideas, yet he controlled Soviet research for thirty years. Lysenkoism ended in the 1960s, but Russian biology still has not entirely recovered from that era.

Now we are engaged in a great new theory that once again has drawn the support of politicians, scientists, and celebrities around the world.

* Once again, the theory is promoted by major foundations.
* Once again, the research is carried out at prestigious universities.
* Once again, legislation is passed and social programs are urged in its name.
* Once again, critics are few and harshly dealt with.
* Once again, the measures being urged have little basis in fact or science.
* Once again, groups with other agendas are hiding behind a movement that appears high-minded.
* Once again, claims of moral superiority are used to justify extreme actions.
* Once again, the fact that some people are hurt is shrugged off because an abstract cause is said to be greater than any human consequences.
* Once again, vague terms like sustainability and generational justice — terms that have no agreed definition — are employed in the service of a new crisis.

I am not arguing that global warming is the same as eugenics. But the similarities are not superficial. And I do claim that open and frank discussion of the data, and of the issues, is being suppressed. Leading scientific journals have taken strong editorial positions of the side of global warming, which, I argue, they have no business doing. Under the circumstances, any scientist who has doubts understands clearly that they will be wise to mute their expression.

One proof of this suppression is the fact that so many of the outspoken critics of global warming are retired professors. These individuals are not longer seeking grants, and no longer have to face colleagues whose grant applications and career advancement may be jeopardized by their criticisms.

In science, the old men are usually wrong. But in politics, the old men are wise, counsel caution, and in the end are often right.

The past history of human belief is a cautionary tale. We have killed thousands of our fellow human beings because we believed they had signed a contract with the devil, and had become witches. We still kill more than a thousand people each year for witchcraft. In my view, there is only one hope for humankind to emerge from what Carl Sagan called “the demon-haunted world” of our past. That hope is science.

But as Alston Chase put it, “when the search for truth is confused with political advocacy, the pursuit of knowledge is reduced to the quest for power.”

Why Politicized Science is Dangerous # ""Those who can make you believe absurdities can make you commit atrocities""

# ---Voltaire

&amp;#x200B;

**Imagine that there is a new scientific theory that warns of an impending crisis, and points to a way out.**

This theory quickly draws support from leading scientists, politicians and celebrities around the world. Research is funded by distinguished philanthropies, and carried out at prestigious universities. The crisis is reported frequently in the media. The science is taught in college and high school classrooms.

I don’t mean global warming. I’m talking about another theory, which rose to prominence a century ago.

Its supporters included Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, and Winston Churchill. It was approved by Supreme Court justices Oliver Wendell Holmes and Louis Brandeis, who ruled in its favor. The famous names who supported it included Alexander Graham Bell, inventor of the telephone; activist Margaret Sanger; botanist Luther Burbank; Leland Stanford, founder of Stanford University; the novelist H. G. Wells; the playwright George Bernard Shaw; and hundreds of others. Nobel Prize winners gave support. Research was backed by the Carnegie and Rockefeller Foundations. The Cold Springs Harbor Institute was built to carry out this research, but important work was also done at Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Stanford and Johns Hopkins. Legislation to address the crisis was passed in states from New York to California.

These efforts had the support of the National Academy of Sciences, the American Medical Association, and the National Research Council. It was said that if Jesus were alive, he would have supported this effort.

All in all, the research, legislation and molding of public opinion surrounding the theory went on for almost half a century. Those who opposed the theory were shouted down and called reactionary, blind to reality, or just plain ignorant. But in hindsight, what is surprising is that so few people objected.

Today, we know that this famous theory that gained so much support was actually pseudoscience. The crisis it claimed was nonexistent. And the actions taken in the name of theory were morally and criminally wrong. Ultimately, they led to the deaths of millions of people.

**The theory was eugenics, and its history is so dreadful — and, to those who were caught up in it, so embarrassing — that it is now rarely discussed. But it is a story that should be well know to every citizen, so that its horrors are not repeated.**

The theory of eugenics postulated a crisis of the gene pool leading to the deterioration of the human race. The best human beings were not breeding as rapidly as the inferior ones — the foreigners, immigrants, Jews, degenerates, the unfit, and the “feeble minded.” Francis Galton, a respected British scientist, first speculated about this area, but his ideas were taken far beyond anything he intended. They were adopted by science-minded Americans, as well as those who had no interest in science but who were worried about the immigration of inferior races early in the twentieth century — “dangerous human pests” who represented “the rising tide of imbeciles” and who were polluting the best of the human race.

The eugenicists and the immigrationists joined forces to put a stop to this. The plan was to identify individuals who were feeble-minded — Jews were agreed to be largely feeble-minded, but so were many foreigners, as well as blacks — and stop them from breeding by isolation in institutions or by sterilization.

As Margaret Sanger said, “Fostering the good-for-nothing at the expense of the good is an extreme cruelty … there is not greater curse to posterity than that of bequeathing them an increasing population of imbeciles.” She spoke of the burden of caring for “this dead weight of human waste.”

Such views were widely shared. H.G. Wells spoke against “ill-trained swarms of inferior citizens.” Theodore Roosevelt said that “Society has no business to permit degenerates to reproduce their kind.” Luther Burbank” “Stop permitting criminals and weaklings to reproduce.” George Bernard Shaw said that only eugenics could save mankind.

There was overt racism in this movement, exemplified by texts such as “The Rising Tide of Color Against White World Supremacy” by American author Lothrop Stoddard. But, at the time, racism was considered an unremarkable aspect of the effort to attain a marvelous goal — the improvement of humankind in the future. It was this avant-garde notion that attracted the most liberal and progressive minds of a generation. California was one of twenty-nine American states to pass laws allowing sterilization, but it proved the most-forward-looking and enthusiastic — more sterilizations were carried out in California than anywhere else in America.

Eugenics research was funded by the Carnegie Foundation, and later by the Rockefeller Foundation. The latter was so enthusiastic that even after the center of the eugenics effort moved to Germany, and involved the gassing of individuals from mental institutions, the Rockefeller Foundation continued to finance German researchers at a very high level. (The foundation was quiet about it, but they were still funding research in 1939, only months before the onset of World War II.)

Since the 1920s, American eugenicists had been jealous because the Germans had taken leadership of the movement away from them. The Germans were admirably progressive. They set up ordinary-looking houses where “mental defectives” were brought and interviewed one at a time, before being led into a back room, which was, in fact, a gas chamber. There, they were gassed with carbon monoxide, and their bodies disposed of in a crematorium located on the property.

Eventually, this program was expanded into a vast network of concentration camps located near railroad lines, enabling the efficient transport and of killing of 'undesirables'.

After World War II, nobody was a eugenicist, and nobody had ever been a eugenicist. Biographers of the celebrated and the powerful did not dwell on the attractions of this philosophy to their subjects, and sometimes did not mention it at all. Eugenics ceased to be a subject for college classrooms, although some argue that its ideas continue to have currency in disguised form.

But in retrospect, three points stand out. First, despite the construction of Cold Springs Harbor Laboratory, despite the efforts of universities and the pleadings of lawyers, there was no scientific basis for eugenics. In fact, nobody at that time knew what a gene really was. The movement was able to proceed because it employed vague terms never rigorously defined. “Feeble-mindedness” could mean anything from poverty to illiteracy to epilepsy. Similarly, there was no clear definition of “degenerate” or “unfit.”

Second, the eugenics movement was really a social program masquerading as a scientific one. What drove it was concern about immigration and racism and undesirable people moving into one’s neighborhood or country. Once again, vague terminology helped conceal what was really going on.

Third, and most distressing, the scientific establishment in both the United States and Germany did not mount any sustained protest. Quite the contrary. In Germany scientists quickly fell into line with the program. Modern German researchers have gone back to review Nazi documents from the 1930s. They expected to find directives telling scientists what research should be done. But none were necessary. In the words of Ute Deichman, “Scientists, including those who were not members of the \[Nazi\] party, helped to get funding for their work through their modified behavior and direct cooperation with the state.” Deichman speaks of the “active role of scientists themselves in regard to Nazi race policy … where \[research\] was aimed at confirming the racial doctrine … no external pressure can be documented.” German scientists adjusted their research interests to the new policies. And those few who did not adjust disappeared.

A second example of politicized science is quite different in character, but it exemplifies the hazard of government ideology controlling the work of science, and of uncritical media promoting false concepts. Trofim Denisovich Lysenko was a self-promoting peasant who, it was said, “solved the problem of fertilizing the fields without fertilizers and minerals.” In 1928 he claimed to have invented a procedure called vernalization, by which seeds were moistened and chilled to enhance the later growth of crops.

Lysenko’s methods never faced a rigorous test, but his claim that his treated seeds passed on their characteristics to the next generation represented a revival of Lamarckian ideas at a time when the rest of the world was embracing Mendelian genetics. Josef Stalin was drawn to Lamarckian ideas, which implied a future unbounded by hereditary constraints; he also wanted improved agricultural production. Lysenko promised both, and became the darling of a Soviet media that was on the lookout for stories about clever peasants who had developed revolutionary procedures.

Lysenko was portrayed as a genius, and he milked his celebrity for all it was worth. He was especially skillful at denouncing this opponents. He used questionnaires from farmers to prove that vernalization increased crop yields, and thus avoided any direct tests. Carried on a wave of state-sponsored enthusiasm, his rise was rapid. By 1937, he was a member of the Supreme Soviet.

By then, Lysenko and his theories dominated Russian biology. The result was famines that killed millions, and purges that sent hundreds of dissenting Soviet scientists to the gulags or the firing squads. Lysenko was aggressive in attacking genetics, which was finally banned as “bourgeois pseudoscience” in 1948. There was never any basis for Lysenko’s ideas, yet he controlled Soviet research for thirty years. Lysenkoism ended in the 1960s, but Russian biology still has not entirely recovered from that era.

Now we are engaged in a great new theory that once again has drawn the support of politicians, scientists, and celebrities around the world.

* Once again, the theory is promoted by major foundations.
* Once again, the research is carried out at prestigious universities.
* Once again, legislation is passed and social programs are urged in its name.
* Once again, critics are few and harshly dealt with.
* Once again, the measures being urged have little basis in fact or science.
* Once again, groups with other agendas are hiding behind a movement that appears high-minded.
* Once again, claims of moral superiority are used to justify extreme actions.
* Once again, the fact that some people are hurt is shrugged off because an abstract cause is said to be greater than any human consequences.
* Once again, vague terms like sustainability and generational justice — terms that have no agreed definition — are employed in the service of a new crisis.

I am not arguing that global warming is the same as eugenics. But the similarities are not superficial. And I do claim that open and frank discussion of the data, and of the issues, is being suppressed. Leading scientific journals have taken strong editorial positions of the side of global warming, which, I argue, they have no business doing. Under the circumstances, any scientist who has doubts understands clearly that they will be wise to mute their expression.

One proof of this suppression is the fact that so many of the outspoken critics of global warming are retired professors. These individuals are not longer seeking grants, and no longer have to face colleagues whose grant applications and career advancement may be jeopardized by their criticisms.

In science, the old men are usually wrong. But in politics, the old men are wise, counsel caution, and in the end are often right.

The past history of human belief is a cautionary tale. We have killed thousands of our fellow human beings because we believed they had signed a contract with the devil, and had become witches. We still kill more than a thousand people each year for witchcraft. In my view, there is only one hope for humankind to emerge from what Carl Sagan called “the demon-haunted world” of our past. That hope is science.

But as Alston Chase put it, “when the search for truth is confused with political advocacy, the pursuit of knowledge is reduced to the quest for power.”

That is the danger we now face. And this is why the intermixing of science and politics is a bad combination, with a bad history. We must remember the history, and be certain that what we present to the world as knowledge is disinterested and honest.

I've been doing activism lately, among other things against climate change. It has occurred to me that while I am somewhat familiar with the arguments, studies and data that suggest human made climate change is real, I do not know much about arguments and data that suggest the opposite.

I want to see both sides here so I can draw my own conclusions having seen all the arguments, I don't want to form my opinion on the topic with only information from my echo chamber. Please send me arguments against climate change, as well as scientific studies. I have lots of free time in the next 24 hours, so I can hopefully read through several studies.

Here's my current opinion on the topic so we'll have a starting point for the debate:

""Greenhouse gases like CO2, methane and others are causing the greenhouse gas effect which increases the average temperature on Earth's surface. This has allowed life on Earth to develop in the first place. Due to heavy use of fossil fuels, animal agriculture and others, humanity is rapidly increasing the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, pushing the warming effect beyond the natural balance. This is, and will be causing, according to scientific predictions, biodiversity loss, an increase of global mean temperature, an increase of extreme weather events, loss of arable land to desertification loss of living space due to flooding, and several hundreds of millions of refugees.""

I look forward to an enlightening conversation and to reading some studies. Thanks in advance for sending me arguments and sources.

I am from r/collapse. It is rank with confirmation bias. I came here for some good counter arguments and hopefully good news.,"I am from r/collapse. I joined some 2 months back when i found it while browsing some other news article regarding doomsday.

We have absolutely no hopeful news there at all. This can't be. There are people doing a lot of stuff and there has to be some good news. This smelled like confirmation bias. So I came here looking for counter arguments.

Here is what i know:

1. Permafrost has a lot of methane frozen away. (Is this true? How did it get frozen there in the first place?)

2. Methane is a very potent green house gas. Depending upon how you count it is 70-83 times more potent than CO2.

3. We have taken carbon out of the ground and released it into the atmosphere in last 150 years. We increased the co2 levels to 412ppm from~250ppm. This has already increased the average temp by 0.8C from pre industrial levels.


4. Increasing temperature melts white ice that reflects suns light. This creating a feedback loop that further increases the temp.

5. One day we will melt permafrost and release methane. This will dramatically increase temperature. This will melt more permafrost and release more methane and thus create another feedback loop.

6. All this temp increase will be as bad as permian extinction when some volcano caused this permafrost (or was it clathrate) to release methane and kill 90% of all life. This is extremely bad scenario when permafrost releases 5% of its methane in to the air when one fine day melting sets off one of the clathrate guns.

Meanwhile increasing temps would cause extreme weathers, disrupt food security, increase spread of diseases which were checked by cool climate etc. etc. humans are bad neighbors under stressful conditions and we have a collapse.",0,"I am from r/collapse.

You're all a bunch of pseudo-intellectual fools.,"If any of you had a half a brain, you'd unsubscribe from this sham of a subreddit, and go subscribe to a good sub. Seriously, you people are actually skeptical of climate change? When all the signs of it are slapping you in the face?

The ice caps melting at an alarming rate each year, negatively affecting thousands of animals.

Ticks will migrate into and infest areas where you used to enjoy hiking, due to them coming out earlier each year.

Trees killed in an unprecedented flood in Italy. Mass cattle die-off in Australia's post-drought floods.

Look up the ski resort in Chacaltaya, Bolivia and see how it's doing.

Each year, human beings release an increasing amount of carbon dioxide (C02) into the atmosphere; at present, around 40 billion tons per annum.

In 2018, there were 14 weather and climate disaster events with losses exceeding $1 billion each across the United States.

A small rodent named  the Bramble Cay melomys that lived only on a single island off Australia is likely the world's first mammal to become a casualty of climate change. Since 1998, the part of the island that sits above high tide has shrunk from 9.8 acres to 6.2 acres. That means the island's vegetation has been shrinking, and the rodents have lost about 97 percent of their habitat.

Or how about all of these actual facts presented here:  [https://www.un.org/en/sections/issues-depth/climate-change/](https://www.un.org/en/sections/issues-depth/climate-change/)

The First Global Revolution (1991),"My cause for skepticism lies in the motives of those who refer to climate change to demand more power and money from the people. If you trace back the history of UN groups and activities on climate change, you'll quickly arrive at the think tank ""Club of Rome"" which was founded among others by David Rockefeller (oil and banking billionaire).

This think tank published an initial critique on economic growth (""The Limits to Growth"") in 1972, followed by - more interestingly - a blueprint to how the world should be run in the 21st century: ""The First Global Revolution"". This latter book was published in 1991, closely preceding the UN conference in Rio in 1992 that kicked off environmental efforts (from the UN perspective that's Agenda 21 followed by Agenda 2030).

They literally said in the book, and this does appear to be a legitimate quote:

&gt;Because of the sudden absence of traditional enemies, ""new enemies must be identified.""[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_First_Global_Revolution#cite_note-King70-2)  ""**In searching for a new enemy to unite us, we came up with the idea  that pollution, the threat of global warming, water shortages, famine  and the like would fit the bill**....All these dangers are caused by human  intervention, and it is only through changed attitudes and behavior  that they can be overcome. The real enemy then, is humanity itself.""[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_First_Global_Revolution#cite_note-King115-3)

So this would be quite consistent with the idea that environmental problems are being hijacked in an effort to gain power and money for unelected elites, in essence taking us back to NWO conspiracies. Looking into the background of many UN representatives, they are in many cases also from big oil and finance, and some have been involved in bad corruption scandals, so it's not an immediately credible claim to make that they are in it purely for the good of all mankind.

There's also this ongoing conflict between UN / Western goals of reducing CO2 emissions and supporting mass immigration and overpopulation, most of which typically trace back to rich and powerful supporters as well ( [http://www.centuryinitiative.ca/about/](http://www.centuryinitiative.ca/about/) , [https://www.weforum.org/reports/business-case-migration](https://www.weforum.org/reports/business-case-migration) , [https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-18519395](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-18519395) ).

There's the argument that nobody cares for the UN anyway and they have no say in anything, but Western governments and supranational organizations largely seem to agree immediately on most of these things. I'm not  sure how these dominant globalist organizations relate to socialist / green parties though.

As far as today's news in the Middle East and the climate of events there, Jpost.com of Jerusalem for weather and other such; and the very interesting Dailystar.com.lb from Beirut, which gives a more expansive and interesting viewpoint about Middle East events and climate events, as well.

Lots of times the Jpost and the Daily Star are the ONLY sources giving details about what's going on with the weather there, confirming the problems, as well. Such as the loss of about 50% of Iran's Agro land and spring plantings, which will have a devastatin effect upon their food production. Starvation widely is possible.

And 40% of bridges and transport infrastructure damaged by storms, well past easy repairs, within the last few weeks.

So, I am going to purpose what I think is an unpopular idea and see how others feel. So, I agree that climate change is real and we're causing it. BUT, I argue that the climate we want to maintain is OUR climate.

The earth has seen many different climates and even land shapes in it's history. There are many factors both on this ball of rock and in the space we fly through that effect air temperature, rain volumes, hurricanes, etc etc everyday.

We're hoping to find a way to maintain the status quo of this epoch of the earth's history, which is dominated by large, warm blooded animals that have live births. We want to maintain it within these limits to ensure that our very special species can continue on growing and adapt till we even possibly reach the stars...

That's all great, but neither ""the earth"" nor life on it much care about that. I believe no matter how bad we screw it up even to the point of nuclear winter, the earth WILL recover and life WILL go on. I know that it could take 100s of millions of years to get back to the diversity we have today, but I honestly believe it WILL happen no mater what we do.

To that end, I am saying that even our most ardent environmentalists are trying to protect something that is inherently selfish, OUR world. There is NO way that we can predict that might come AFTER us would be better or worse. Yet, WHO are we to decide how and when it happens?",0,"Won't it all solve itself in the long run of this planet?

We want to maintain it within these limits to ensure that our very special species can continue on growing and adapt till we even possibly reach the stars...

That's all great, but neither ""the earth"" nor life on it much care about that. I believe no matter how bad we screw it up even to the point of nuclear winter, the earth WILL recover and life WILL go on. I know that it could take 100s of millions of years to get back to the diversity we have today, but I honestly believe it WILL happen no mater what we do.

To that end, I am saying that even our most ardent environmentalists are trying to protect something that is inherently selfish, OUR world. There is NO way that we can predict that might come AFTER us would be better or worse. Yet, WHO are we to decide how and when it happens?"

Skepticism vs Denialism,"Seen far too many posts and comments on here that seem to confuse the two. 

If you’re skeptical, you don’t believe something but it’s still possible for you to believe it’s  true or exists.

I just got ghosted by a commenter here (you know who you are) who got frustrated and decided I was being unreasonable and wasn’t worth replying to. This was because I was skeptical of what he said, and I thoroughly supported my contention.  I see this a lot too, not just here. Commenters just seemingly ceasing to exist when another makes a good point they can’t disprove easily. 

I understand leaving a conversation if the other is being rude or is dense, but if you’d rather ditch a conversation that you can’t win instead of actually think about what the other is saying, then you’re not being very skeptical are ya?

You’re allowed to believe whatever you want, but if you’re not gonna bother actually being skeptical, you’re just a Denier.",0,"Skepticism vs Denialism Seen far too many posts and comments on here that seem to confuse the two.

China and Climate Hysteria,"I asked a friend who lived in China for years whether there is media coverage there about global warming and urgent appeals to take action to stop it.  Here is what he said.
-------

In the pre-Xi days there were environmentalists that were calling out the situation in China.  However most of these coalesced around international NGOs.  When Xi came into power the govt clamped down on international NGOs and closed down online media that was not congruent with Chinese government policy.

At the same time the Chinese government know it has an environmental disaster on its hands and knows as part of its ability to maintain control of public sentiment it must address the environmental hazards that are apparent to all people.  

There is no independent media.  So any call on the government to ""take action to reduce emissions"" would have to come from the government itself, which controls the media.",0,"China and Climate Hysteria I asked a friend who lived in China for years whether there is media coverage there about global warming and urgent appeals to take action to stop it.

I thought, ""How unusual is that?"" and discovered, not very. For example, Tuktoyaktuk - July 2, 1998, 30.4°C (86.7°F). 

However, when I checked other locations around the Arctic Ocean the information became vague. For example, the weather base report for Murmansk states:

This suggests the record was set last July without actually saying so.

"""Climate Changed"" Nobel Conference - propaganda or science?","  

Happy Sunday! I’m incredibly impressed with the depth of knowledge on this thread. I’m sharing this for a 10k ft assessment and partially for the amusement factor.

My alma mater holds an annual Nobel Conference. I usually ignore most emails from them, but the topic of this year’s conference caught my eye. **“Climate Changed”**… past tense. I took a quick look at the agenda and politely asked which speaker represented the contrarian opinion (see response below). The response was that “no one will represent that view”, “the Nobel Conference cannot present a position with no support”, and that “the scientific consensus is clear and unassailable”. It’s pointless to engage in a lengthy debate, but I’m willing to make one more attempt to suggest that this conference is closer to propaganda-fest than scientific discussion.

Here are my questions for the group (looking for quick-twitch bullets). Where do these speakers rank on the zealot scale? How many contributors were in the group that received the climate change Nobel Prize? How politically compromised is the Nobel Foundation? Who are the leading academics in the ‘skeptic’ community?

Why China Gets a Pass,"The earth is currently habitable despite climate change.  The alarm being sounded is that if emissions *increase* we are doomed. However, Asia is where emissions are rapidly increasing while the West is nearly flat. Therefore controlling Asian emissions should be a primary goal to avert the predicted climate disaster. 

However, the people concerned about climate on Reddit are unconcerned about China's rapidly increasing emissions.  Whenever anyone posts proof in various subs that the US is flat on emissions, downvotes ensue. There is intense focus on fixing blame on the U.S. no matter what positive facts are shared.

Having helped implement Chinese government PR campaigns they designed to influence their trade negotiations with President Bush, I've personally witnessed the Chinese being very strong with managing political issues. I've helped Chinese buyers orchestrate media coverage of multi-billion-dollar purchases of goods like heavy equipment and ag commodities for the sole purpose of influencing trade negotiations to their benefit.

What are your five main beliefs?,"There is often severe polarisation within the climate debate. Hopefully a greater understanding of beliefs will resolve this.

I will start.

- Carbon dioxide enhances the greenhouse effect.

- Humans are approximately 50% for climate change.

- Extreme weather events are not on the uptrend. At least the deaths caused by them.

- Climate models should not be taken literally as they rarely include feedback loops and they smoothen out certain long-term trends.

- Our current understanding of the climate system is shaky.

Edit: Shaky might be the wrong word, we have a very good understanding on some aspects, but not others.

Bin Wars - a prelude to Carbon Wars,"The UK has had Bin Wars for a few years. Bin Wars have now arrived in Western Australia courtesy of the state government. The standard bin arrangement is a general waste bin and a recyclables bin. The definition of recyclables varies from country to country. Likewise the arrangements made. Often recyclables are, after collection, put through to general waste. The state government is now waging Bin Wars on the local populace via the local councils.

Bin Wars means extra bins with coloured lids are now being supplied by the local councils. Each bin has a sticker that authorises its use. These are for general waste and for various categories of recyclables. And a one size fits all approach is being made. eg. people often use kitchen waste for their gardens or they just bury it. However you will be given a kitchen waste bin in which you can accumulate over many months a stinking soggy mass of kitchen waste which will add to the pleasant and natural odeur of your surrounds and drive your visitors away.

Next the councils will chip the bins and examine the contents and they will send a break down of the contents to an app. on your smartphone. This is already operational in some places.

And if you think that this is a massive waste of money and resources and you point out to all the petroleum being used in the extra bins you are 100% right.

15 Reasons to be Skeptical of Human Caused Climate Change,"**1) CO2 has a trivial warming effect.** 

The  measured radiative forcing at the surface from CO2 from 2000-2010 was  0.2 W/m2 from the 22ppmv increase (Feldman et al 2012), which works out  at about 0.01 W/m2 per 1ppmv. However, because of the logarithmic nature  of CO2, regular 1ppmv increments of CO2 would produce ever-diminishing  increments of radiative forcing and so 0.01 W/m2 per 1ppmv would be a  generous linear relationship to use as of 2018. According to the [**Keeling Curve**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keeling_Curve),  CO2 is increasing at the rate of about 2.5 ppmv/year. Therefore, the  annual radiative forcing from CO2 would be about 0.025 W/m2, which would  be enough to raise the global temperature at the surface by about  0.0046°C under the S-B law\*1 (assuming none of it gets absorbed in the  evaporation of seawater). Far from being catastrophic, such a trivial  rate of warming would be lost in the inaccuracies of the measurements.

**2) The effects of CO2 are overwhelmed by water vapour.**

The  Earth’s mean surface temperature is currently about 15°C while its   blackbody temperature is -18°C and the temperature difference of   about 33°C represents a large amount of ‘radiative forcing’ by the   atmospheric greenhouse. In fact it amounts to [**about**](https://www.giss.nasa.gov/research/briefs/schmidt_05/) 153 W/m2. The concentration of water vapour in the atmosphere is on average 1% (Source: [**NASA Earth Fact Sheet**](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-VBj5y2ptTg0/W6RlfaUqyII/AAAAAAAAJdw/aHTI3fI1sTwuBJ40j-BkRP12N6FliObcACPcBGAYYCw/s1600/fffffffffffw.PNG))  while the concentration of CO2 is 0.04%. Hence water vapour is about 25  times more abundant than CO2 in the atmosphere and pound for pound it  also has a greater potency than CO2 as well because it absorbs energy  over a far wider frequency in the electromagnetic spectrum (See graph [**here**](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-xNGgmlI9ei8/W5uz3ogVBFI/AAAAAAAAJXE/xKJnvu1IFhoHPtsAY0BUdb0_d0sdfxWmgCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/uohfewiufhiuhuigfrhyg.gif)). CO2 comprises  approximately 4% of the total atmospheric greenhouse by volume and  since it is a weaker greenhouse gas than  water vapour it follows logically that it cannot be  contributing anymore than 6 W/m2 to the total greenhouse radiative  forcing of 153 W/m2 whereas water vapour should contribute upwards of  146 W/m2. 

**3) The 13C/12C  ratio confirms that CO2 has a small life-time and because of this short  life-time there is only a tiny percentage of human CO2 residing in the  atmosphere.** The short atmospheric life-time for CO2 has been  confirmed by the observations of the atmospheric 13C/12C ratio. Some 99%  of atmospheric CO2 consists of the 12C isotope with the remaining 1%  consisting of 13C. The 13C/12C ratio is commonly referred to as δ13C.  δ13C is the difference between the ratio of 13C/12C  in a substance  compared to the standard of Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite  (VPDB) minus one.  The number is multiplied by one-thousand and expressed  as “per mil”  (parts per thousand). Anthropogenic CO2 has an approximate δ13C of  about [**-29**](http://cdiac.ess-dive.lbl.gov/trends/emis_mon/emis_mon_co2) (with  values ranging from -20 to -44) and natural biogenic CO2 is similar  with a δ13C of -26. The natural atmospheric CO2 reservoir has a δ13C of  about -7 when in [**equilibrium**](http://www.co2web.info/ESEFVO1.pdf) with dissolved CO2 in the oceans. The CO2 in the atmosphere (as of 2015) has a δ13C of [**-8.3**](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Yr37ZhP6xIE/W46ueSK06hI/AAAAAAAAJTs/ckZHyVpSt_c0l3Qnj6iGvcKYuQkQYkQ_wCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/c13_mlo_spo.png). Thus, the amount of anthropogenic CO2 in   
the  atmosphere is around 6%\*2 (i.e. 6% of -29 and 94% of -7) with the rest  of CO2 in the atmosphere (i.e. 94%)  being isotopically-indistinguishable\*3 from natural sources.

**4)  The demonstrable impotence of atmospheric CO2 as a driver of global  warming is evidenced by the fact that from 1998-2012 the global surface  temperature increased at the risible rate of 0.05°C per decade** (Source: [**IPCC AR5**](https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/syr/SYR_AR5_FINAL_full.pdf)) despite the fact that humans emitted a total of 30% of our cumulative emissions since 1850 (See graph [**here**](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-MAl1ps75dhk/W6KDJnCSQeI/AAAAAAAAJdY/i5dPwPihldQD-Gcbl8Xlbmmaj26xovHAQCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/global-co2-human-emissions-250-years-30-50-85.gif)).

**5) The “97% consensus” figure that CAGW-advocates faithfully, unremittingly parrot is misleading.**

One of the most cited papers purporting to demonstrate a 97% consensus on AGW was [**John Cook 2013**](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/8/2/024024).   This paper referenced a total of 12,271 papers and these papers were   split up into 7 categories. Category 1 included only 65 papers that   claimed humans were the “primary cause” of global warming. Category 2  included 934 papers that acknowledged AGW was a “known fact”. Category 3  included 2,933 papers that acknowledged “greenhouse gases cause  warning”. Category 4 took “no position” and 5, 6, 7, either implicitly  or explicitly rejected AGW. The 97% consensus was arrived at by taking  the first 4 categories (which had around 12,000 papers) and counting  them as “for” AGW. However, most CAGW-skeptics would agree that AGW is  a “known fact” and that “greenhouse gases cause warning” and  therefore  skeptics could be included in the 97%. Category 1 was the  only one  which included papers that claimed that humans were the  “primary cause”  of global warming (i.e. over 50%) and that included only  65  papers. The 97% consensus that humans are the “primary cause” of global  warming is really a 0.5% consensus (i.e. 65 papers of 12,271) because  category 1 was the only category that explicitly endorsed the idea that  humans were the “primary cause” of global warming.

**6)  CO2 behaves somewhat logarithmically and the more of it there is in the atmosphere the less warming each molecule will have.**  The logarithmic effect of CO2 is  apparently due to the availability of  photons of the required frequency  that are absorbed. The vast majority  of the warming from CO2 comes from the first 20ppmv and after  that CO2 has essentially no effect (See graph [**here**](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-r7V5GVWdyGM/W6EZLvTg2wI/AAAAAAAAJYY/fd4rTV8Pn6cEVUAY-NqUr_kJI3urEhl8wCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/log-graph-lindzen-choi-webyyyyyy.gif)). The  insignificance of CO2 as  a climate driver is further corroborated by  the fact that Atmospheric  Emitted Radiance Interferometer measurements  have shown that the warming  from CO2 amounts to 0.01 W/m2 per 1ppmv  ([**Feldman et al 2012**](http://asl.umbc.edu/pub/chepplew/journals/nature14240_v519_Feldman_CO2.pdf)). That means every 1ppmv of CO2 that stays in the atmosphere has a warming effect at the surface of 0.0018°C.

**7) CO2  is  often claimed to be higher than it has been for about 650,000  thousand  years, thereby implying that the 40% increase in  atmospheric CO2 since 1850 must be human-induced.**

This  is based on ice-core data. However, ice-core is not a “closed-system”  and various fractionation processes such as gravitational compression  and the formation of clathrates can [**underestimate and contaminate**](http://21sci-tech.com/2006_articles/IceCoreSprg97.pdf) the original gas concentrations within the ice. Stomata data and direct chemical measurements ([**Georg Beck 2007**](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1260/095830507780682147)) show more variability with atmospheric CO2 as high as [**440ppmv**](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-eMhJrcf2W7s/W6dshBFvQII/AAAAAAAAJfg/frE0RtQC0N0wQsZUUkrAakJuoYblcASCQCKgBGAs/s1600/NY20081e.jpg). Furthermore,  different ice-core extraction methods can yield different results. The  long-term wet-extraction method shows CO2 as high as 900ppmv ([**Jaworowski et al 1992**](http://www.co2web.info/np-m-119.pdf)) whereas the short-term extraction method shows much lower concentrations. 

**8) The  rate of warming is not unusual. It’s  often suggested that the current  rate of warming is unprecedented, thereby implying that the current  warming must be caused by humans.**

But  the IPCC may want to explain why the global mean surface temperature   increased at virtually the same rate from 1860-1880, as it did between   1910-1940 and from 1975-1998 and 1975-2009 (See [**here**](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-jWcLoyM1uTE/Ww_HdRXxaKI/AAAAAAAAIzs/GBcuzYZXPfYqa2d32kQuEWI7e3RINdLzwCKgBGAs/s1600/Hadley-global-temps-1850-2010-web.gif)).  Human CO2-emissions  increased by almost 3,500% from 1860-1880 to  1975-1998 and yet the rate  of warming stayed essentially the same. The  warming between the years  1860-1880 must have been natural because the  IPCC’s own [**logarithmic equation**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiative_forcing) for  calculating radiative forcing (RF) increases from CO2 increases only  gives 0.028 W/m2 of RF (or a total temperature increase of about  0.02°C — with the hypothesized positive [**feedbacks included**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiative_forcing)). The data for anthropogenic CO2-emissions are from CDIAC and it can be seen [**here**](http://cdiac.ess-dive.lbl.gov/ftp/ndp030/global.1751_2011.ems) (note  that units are million metric tonnes; to convert to CO2 multiply by  3.67 and then to convert to gigatonnes divide by 1,000). The  time-periods and warming trends below are from the [**2010 BBC interview with climatologist Phil Jones**](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8511670.stm).

**9) Clouds could explain a portion of the assumed temperature  increase between 1971-2009.**  Clouds simultaneously cool and warm the  planet. They reflect incoming  solar radiation back out into space  contributing to the planet’s albedo  and they warm the planet by  re-emitting long-wave radiation back  towards the surface. Their overall  effect is to cool the planet to a  tune of [**20**](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ywxyJSBChUo/W54rkYaQ59I/AAAAAAAAJXs/ruCU3GM32XA3O_TuSczdEfD9-LHnD9TKwCPcBGAYYCw/s640/Captureygfyhfyhfhf.PNG) W/m2. Therefore, a general decrease in cloud-cover will lead to warming. [**Warren et al 2012**](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RaI3Zb-vWk0/W5ZpKlUOc1I/AAAAAAAAJVo/KYLKg_GF2Z8S733K1Oo0vSgrLPnfsEQoQCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/global_cloudiness%2B%25281%2529iiii.png)  estimates a reduction in global cloudiness of 1.56% between  1971-2009. Assuming a reduction in general global cloudiness of 1.56%  that equates to 3 W/m2 of increased shortwave radiation according to  Reed’s (1977) Flux [**Formula**](https://www.pmel.noaa.gov/pubs/outstand/mcph1166/mcph1166.shtml).  However, for every 3 W/m2 of radiation that clouds warm the planet by  due to re-emitting long-wave radiation they have a cooling effect of  5 W/m2 due to reflecting incoming shortwave radiation ([**IPCC AR5**](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ywxyJSBChUo/W54rkYaQ59I/AAAAAAAAJXs/ruCU3GM32XA3O_TuSczdEfD9-LHnD9TKwCPcBGAYYCw/s640/Captureygfyhfyhfhf.PNG)).  An increase in shortwave radiation of 3 W/m2 due to a decrease in  cloud-cover will lead to a net-warming of 1.2 W/m2. So, a decrease in  cloudiness is one possible explanation for global warming.

**10)  The mathematical  properties of the growth curves for human CO2-emissions and  atmospheric CO2 contents are unequivocal in showing that some source  other than the human one must be contributing significantly to the  atmospheric CO2 rise.**

Between  1990-2003 anthropogenic CO2-emissions were relatively stable — as  atmospheric CO2 accelerated  away from human emissions, which means that  some source other than  human emissions must be driving the  acceleration. That non-human source  is presently unidentified, but we  can tell that it must exist. Moreover  from 2003-2010  anthropogenic CO2-emissions accelerated while the  atmospheric CO2 growth-rate remained relatively flat. Hence there is a  definite mismatch (See graph below from [**Francey et al 2013**](https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate1817))

**11) The IPCC claim that the long life-time for atmospheric CO2 is  due to the Revelle Factor.** 

Regarding  the Revelle Factor, Bolin et al  1959 states: “Less than 10% of the  excess fossil CO2 in the atmosphere  should have been taken up by the  mixed-layer (or surface-ocean). It is  therefore obvious that the  mixed-layer acts as a bottleneck in the  transport of fossil  fuel CO2 to the deep-sea”. This bottleneck inhibiting the transport of  anthropogenic CO2 to the deep-ocean would appear to be at odds with  removal of anthropogenic 14CO2 from the atmosphere after the 1963+  nuclear test-ban treaty. These tests doubled the concentration  of 14CO2 in the atmosphere above its natural equilibrium concentration.  The observations show a half-life for 14CO2 of 10-12 years (See graph [**here**](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-6HYEWmdDVis/W9MCf5t32nI/AAAAAAAAJ4c/2UpthEhexuox7bh4gRbsIZfuqrM0nHnSgCLcBGAs/s1600/rabiit.PNG)).  Equilibration would therefore essentially be complete by 94% after 4  half-lives =  40-48 years. Considering that the combined amount of  carbon in the  soil, vegetation and surface-ocean is 3,400 gigatonnes  (according to the  IPCC) and the total amount of carbon in the  atmosphere is 800  gigatonnes then if such a bottleneck existed in the  surface-ocean, the  concentration of 14CO2 in the atmosphere would then  have stabilized at around 23% (i.e. 800/3400). With only around 4%  of 14CO2 remaining in the atmosphere today it implies that the 14CO2 has  become mixed with a reservoir 25 times larger than the amount of CO2 in  the atmosphere and the only place that much CO2 is  known to exist and  be in exchange with the atmosphere is in the  deep-oceans. Ergo, the  IPCC are wrong about the Revelle Factor causing a  bottleneck in the  surface-ocean.

**12) According to the** [**Arrhenius equation**](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-973QH3WVgiQ/W6Y6jn8MlpI/AAAAAAAAJek/q1imUyFI18Q-AShiFe_qT36qRiTKzrpfQCLcBGAs/s400/co2forcing%2B%25281%2529.PNG) **for calculating how CO2 catches heat the warming on Mars should be larger.** 

“The  Mars atmosphere is highly amenable to empirical testing of  Arrhenius’ equation  because its climate-system contains no real  significant  feedback-mechanisms to complicate or modify the direct and  immediate  response of the CO2 in terms of the amount of radiative  forcing that it is supposed to produce”. When the Arrhenius equation is  applied to  the planet of Mars things go horribly wrong. There the  observed global  warming (according to NASA’s revised Fact Sheet) is  about 0.2°K (or  about 0.5 W/m2). The revised NASA data shows an  effective temperature for Mars of 209.8°K (See [**NASA Mars Fact Sheet**](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-4i6jeX8OZHs/W6Em27RIOyI/AAAAAAAAJYk/1kZOvJ8RHCgifn56YDTRgM1YeBhZiADtgCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Capture1.PNG))  and an average global surface temperature of \~210°K. This is  interesting when one considers that Mars has a CO2 density approximately  27 times higher than on Earth — at 165 kg/m2 and 6 kg/m2 respectively  and on Earth CO2 is claimed to increase the global average surface  temperature by 6°K (or 32 W/m2). The CO2 on Mars apparently produces 30  times less warming despite being 27 times more abundant.

**13) The IPCC may have** [**overestimated**](http://notrickszone.com/50-papers-low-sensitivity/) **climate sensitivity.**

**14) Atmospheric CO2 has been shown to lag temperature-changes (See the graph** [**here**](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-zKbp5ZEkW9Q/W6FTE7sEXTI/AAAAAAAAJZ8/vf3E3T62fNQzZ-QLTtv8kAEWX8AYx2wygCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/UHUHUHUOH.png)**)\*\*\*\*.**

CAGW-advocates  claim that CO2 is driving global temperatures, yet CO2-changes are  lagging behind corresponding temperature-changes. Saying CO2 drives  temperature-changes is tantamount to saying that cancer causes  smoking. The cause-and-effect relationship is backwards. CO2 is trivial.

**15) The predictive performance of the CAGW-models have been completely refuted by real-world observations.**

The graph [**here**](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-QQGu8em0VdQ/W6FkwQXGPmI/AAAAAAAAJaw/1ADa9VUbBGkoEWYsqZjSfyfS3tfgSeBpwCPcBGAYYCw/s640/spencer-models-epic-fail2-628x353.jpg) (from  former NASA scientist Roy Spencer) shows that the IPCC’s models have  overestimated the tropospheric warming. The CAGW-models can be seen to  be irrational and represent the Earth’s climate system so poorly that  they can really only be described as misrepresentations of it. Quote  from Dr. Roy Spencer: “We  can see that 95% of the models have  over-forecast the warming trend  since 1979, whether we use their own  dataset (HADCRUT4) or our satellite  dataset of lower tropospheric  temperatures (UAH)”*.*

[https://chipstero7.blogspot.com/2018/09/15-reasons-to-be-skeptical-of-human.html](https://chipstero7.blogspot.com/2018/09/15-reasons-to-be-skeptical-of-human.html)",0,"15 Reasons to be Skeptical of Human Caused Climate Change **1) CO2 has a trivial warming effect.**

Anthropogenic CO2 has an approximate δ13C of  about [**-29**](http://cdiac.ess-dive.lbl.gov/trends/emis_mon/emis_mon_co2) (with  values ranging from -20 to -44) and natural biogenic CO2 is similar  with a δ13C of -26. The natural atmospheric CO2 reservoir has a δ13C of  about -7 when in [**equilibrium**](http://www.co2web.info/ESEFVO1.pdf) with dissolved CO2 in the oceans. The CO2 in the atmosphere (as of 2015) has a δ13C of [**-8.3**](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Yr37ZhP6xIE/W46ueSK06hI/AAAAAAAAJTs/ckZHyVpSt_c0l3Qnj6iGvcKYuQkQYkQ_wCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/c13_mlo_spo.png). Thus, the amount of anthropogenic CO2 in   
the  atmosphere is around 6%\*2 (i.e. 6% of -29 and 94% of -7) with the rest  of CO2 in the atmosphere (i.e. 94%)  being isotopically-indistinguishable\*3 from natural sources.

**4)  The demonstrable impotence of atmospheric CO2 as a driver of global  warming is evidenced by the fact that from 1998-2012 the global surface  temperature increased at the risible rate of 0.05°C per decade** (Source: [**IPCC AR5**](https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/syr/SYR_AR5_FINAL_full.pdf)) despite the fact that humans emitted a total of 30% of our cumulative emissions since 1850 (See graph [**here**](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-MAl1ps75dhk/W6KDJnCSQeI/AAAAAAAAJdY/i5dPwPihldQD-Gcbl8Xlbmmaj26xovHAQCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/global-co2-human-emissions-250-years-30-50-85.gif)).

**5) The “97% consensus” figure that CAGW-advocates faithfully, unremittingly parrot is misleading.**

One of the most cited papers purporting to demonstrate a 97% consensus on AGW was [**John Cook 2013**](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/8/2/024024).   This paper referenced a total of 12,271 papers and these papers were   split up into 7 categories. Category 1 included only 65 papers that   claimed humans were the “primary cause” of global warming. Category 2  included 934 papers that acknowledged AGW was a “known fact”. Category 3  included 2,933 papers that acknowledged “greenhouse gases cause  warning”. Category 4 took “no position” and 5, 6, 7, either implicitly  or explicitly rejected AGW. The 97% consensus was arrived at by taking  the first 4 categories (which had around 12,000 papers) and counting  them as “for” AGW. However, most CAGW-skeptics would agree that AGW is  a “known fact” and that “greenhouse gases cause warning” and  therefore  skeptics could be included in the 97%. Category 1 was the  only one  which included papers that claimed that humans were the  “primary cause”  of global warming (i.e. over 50%) and that included only  65  papers. The 97% consensus that humans are the “primary cause” of global  warming is really a 0.5% consensus (i.e. 65 papers of 12,271) because  category 1 was the only category that explicitly endorsed the idea that  humans were the “primary cause” of global warming.

**6)  CO2 behaves somewhat logarithmically and the more of it there is in the atmosphere the less warming each molecule will have.**  The logarithmic effect of CO2 is  apparently due to the availability of  photons of the required frequency  that are absorbed. The vast majority  of the warming from CO2 comes from the first 20ppmv and after  that CO2 has essentially no effect (See graph [**here**](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-r7V5GVWdyGM/W6EZLvTg2wI/AAAAAAAAJYY/fd4rTV8Pn6cEVUAY-NqUr_kJI3urEhl8wCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/log-graph-lindzen-choi-webyyyyyy.gif)). The  insignificance of CO2 as  a climate driver is further corroborated by  the fact that Atmospheric  Emitted Radiance Interferometer measurements  have shown that the warming  from CO2 amounts to 0.01 W/m2 per 1ppmv  ([**Feldman et al 2012**](http://asl.umbc.edu/pub/chepplew/journals/nature14240_v519_Feldman_CO2.pdf)). That means every 1ppmv of CO2 that stays in the atmosphere has a warming effect at the surface of 0.0018°C.

**7) CO2  is  often claimed to be higher than it has been for about 650,000  thousand  years, thereby implying that the 40% increase in  atmospheric CO2 since 1850 must be human-induced.**

This  is based on ice-core data. However, ice-core is not a “closed-system”  and various fractionation processes such as gravitational compression  and the formation of clathrates can [**underestimate and contaminate**](http://21sci-tech.com/2006_articles/IceCoreSprg97.pdf) the original gas concentrations within the ice. Stomata data and direct chemical measurements ([**Georg Beck 2007**](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1260/095830507780682147)) show more variability with atmospheric CO2 as high as [**440ppmv**](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-eMhJrcf2W7s/W6dshBFvQII/AAAAAAAAJfg/frE0RtQC0N0wQsZUUkrAakJuoYblcASCQCKgBGAs/s1600/NY20081e.jpg). Furthermore,  different ice-core extraction methods can yield different results. The  long-term wet-extraction method shows CO2 as high as 900ppmv ([**Jaworowski et al 1992**](http://www.co2web.info/np-m-119.pdf)) whereas the short-term extraction method shows much lower concentrations. 

**8) The  rate of warming is not unusual. It’s  often suggested that the current  rate of warming is unprecedented, thereby implying that the current  warming must be caused by humans.**

But  the IPCC may want to explain why the global mean surface temperature   increased at virtually the same rate from 1860-1880, as it did between   1910-1940 and from 1975-1998 and 1975-2009 (See [**here**](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-jWcLoyM1uTE/Ww_HdRXxaKI/AAAAAAAAIzs/GBcuzYZXPfYqa2d32kQuEWI7e3RINdLzwCKgBGAs/s1600/Hadley-global-temps-1850-2010-web.gif)).  Human CO2-emissions  increased by almost 3,500% from 1860-1880 to  1975-1998 and yet the rate  of warming stayed essentially the same. The  warming between the years  1860-1880 must have been natural because the  IPCC’s own [**logarithmic equation**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiative_forcing) for  calculating radiative forcing (RF) increases from CO2 increases only  gives 0.028 W/m2 of RF (or a total temperature increase of about  0.02°C — with the hypothesized positive [**feedbacks included**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiative_forcing)). The data for anthropogenic CO2-emissions are from CDIAC and it can be seen [**here**](http://cdiac.ess-dive.lbl.gov/ftp/ndp030/global.1751_2011.ems) (note  that units are million metric tonnes; to convert to CO2 multiply by  3.67 and then to convert to gigatonnes divide by 1,000). The  time-periods and warming trends below are from the [**2010 BBC interview with climatologist Phil Jones**](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8511670.stm).

**9) Clouds could explain a portion of the assumed temperature  increase between 1971-2009.**  Clouds simultaneously cool and warm the  planet. They reflect incoming  solar radiation back out into space  contributing to the planet’s albedo  and they warm the planet by  re-emitting long-wave radiation back  towards the surface. Their overall  effect is to cool the planet to a  tune of [**20**](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ywxyJSBChUo/W54rkYaQ59I/AAAAAAAAJXs/ruCU3GM32XA3O_TuSczdEfD9-LHnD9TKwCPcBGAYYCw/s640/Captureygfyhfyhfhf.PNG) W/m2. Therefore, a general decrease in cloud-cover will lead to warming. [**Warren et al 2012**](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RaI3Zb-vWk0/W5ZpKlUOc1I/AAAAAAAAJVo/KYLKg_GF2Z8S733K1Oo0vSgrLPnfsEQoQCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/global_cloudiness%2B%25281%2529iiii.png)  estimates a reduction in global cloudiness of 1.56% between  1971-2009. Assuming a reduction in general global cloudiness of 1.56%  that equates to 3 W/m2 of increased shortwave radiation according to  Reed’s (1977) Flux [**Formula**](https://www.pmel.noaa.gov/pubs/outstand/mcph1166/mcph1166.shtml).  However, for every 3 W/m2 of radiation that clouds warm the planet by  due to re-emitting long-wave radiation they have a cooling effect of  5 W/m2 due to reflecting incoming shortwave radiation ([**IPCC AR5**](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ywxyJSBChUo/W54rkYaQ59I/AAAAAAAAJXs/ruCU3GM32XA3O_TuSczdEfD9-LHnD9TKwCPcBGAYYCw/s640/Captureygfyhfyhfhf.PNG)).  An increase in shortwave radiation of 3 W/m2 due to a decrease in  cloud-cover will lead to a net-warming of 1.2 W/m2. So, a decrease in  cloudiness is one possible explanation for global warming.

**10)  The mathematical  properties of the growth curves for human CO2-emissions and  atmospheric CO2 contents are unequivocal in showing that some source  other than the human one must be contributing significantly to the  atmospheric CO2 rise.**

Between  1990-2003 anthropogenic CO2-emissions were relatively stable — as  atmospheric CO2 accelerated  away from human emissions, which means that  some source other than  human emissions must be driving the  acceleration. That non-human source  is presently unidentified, but we  can tell that it must exist. Moreover  from 2003-2010  anthropogenic CO2-emissions accelerated while the  atmospheric CO2 growth-rate remained relatively flat. Hence there is a  definite mismatch (See graph below from [**Francey et al 2013**](https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate1817))

**11) The IPCC claim that the long life-time for atmospheric CO2 is  due to the Revelle Factor.** 

Regarding  the Revelle Factor, Bolin et al  1959 states: “Less than 10% of the  excess fossil CO2 in the atmosphere  should have been taken up by the  mixed-layer (or surface-ocean). It is  therefore obvious that the  mixed-layer acts as a bottleneck in the  transport of fossil  fuel CO2 to the deep-sea”. This bottleneck inhibiting the transport of  anthropogenic CO2 to the deep-ocean would appear to be at odds with  removal of anthropogenic 14CO2 from the atmosphere after the 1963+  nuclear test-ban treaty. These tests doubled the concentration  of 14CO2 in the atmosphere above its natural equilibrium concentration.  The observations show a half-life for 14CO2 of 10-12 years (See graph [**here**](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-6HYEWmdDVis/W9MCf5t32nI/AAAAAAAAJ4c/2UpthEhexuox7bh4gRbsIZfuqrM0nHnSgCLcBGAs/s1600/rabiit.PNG)).  Equilibration would therefore essentially be complete by 94% after 4  half-lives =  40-48 years. Considering that the combined amount of  carbon in the  soil, vegetation and surface-ocean is 3,400 gigatonnes  (according to the  IPCC) and the total amount of carbon in the  atmosphere is 800  gigatonnes then if such a bottleneck existed in the  surface-ocean, the  concentration of 14CO2 in the atmosphere would then  have stabilized at around 23% (i.e. 800/3400). With only around 4%  of 14CO2 remaining in the atmosphere today it implies that the 14CO2 has  become mixed with a reservoir 25 times larger than the amount of CO2 in  the atmosphere and the only place that much CO2 is  known to exist and  be in exchange with the atmosphere is in the  deep-oceans. Ergo, the  IPCC are wrong about the Revelle Factor causing a  bottleneck in the  surface-ocean.

**12) According to the** [**Arrhenius equation**](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-973QH3WVgiQ/W6Y6jn8MlpI/AAAAAAAAJek/q1imUyFI18Q-AShiFe_qT36qRiTKzrpfQCLcBGAs/s400/co2forcing%2B%25281%2529.PNG) **for calculating how CO2 catches heat the warming on Mars should be larger.** 

“The  Mars atmosphere is highly amenable to empirical testing of  Arrhenius’ equation  because its climate-system contains no real  significant  feedback-mechanisms to complicate or modify the direct and  immediate  response of the CO2 in terms of the amount of radiative  forcing that it is supposed to produce”. When the Arrhenius equation is  applied to  the planet of Mars things go horribly wrong. There the  observed global  warming (according to NASA’s revised Fact Sheet) is  about 0.2°K (or  about 0.5 W/m2). The revised NASA data shows an  effective temperature for Mars of 209.8°K (See [**NASA Mars Fact Sheet**](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-4i6jeX8OZHs/W6Em27RIOyI/AAAAAAAAJYk/1kZOvJ8RHCgifn56YDTRgM1YeBhZiADtgCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Capture1.PNG))  and an average global surface temperature of \~210°K. This is  interesting when one considers that Mars has a CO2 density approximately  27 times higher than on Earth — at 165 kg/m2 and 6 kg/m2 respectively  and on Earth CO2 is claimed to increase the global average surface  temperature by 6°K (or 32 W/m2). The CO2 on Mars apparently produces 30  times less warming despite being 27 times more abundant.

**13) The IPCC may have** [**overestimated**](http://notrickszone.com/50-papers-low-sensitivity/) **climate sensitivity.**

**14) Atmospheric CO2 has been shown to lag temperature-changes (See the graph** [**here**](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-zKbp5ZEkW9Q/W6FTE7sEXTI/AAAAAAAAJZ8/vf3E3T62fNQzZ-QLTtv8kAEWX8AYx2wygCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/UHUHUHUOH.png)**)\*\*\*\*.**

CAGW-advocates  claim that CO2 is driving global temperatures, yet CO2-changes are  lagging behind corresponding temperature-changes. Saying CO2 drives  temperature-changes is tantamount to saying that cancer causes  smoking. The cause-and-effect relationship is backwards. CO2 is trivial.

**15) The predictive performance of the CAGW-models have been completely refuted by real-world observations.**

The graph [**here**](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-QQGu8em0VdQ/W6FkwQXGPmI/AAAAAAAAJaw/1ADa9VUbBGkoEWYsqZjSfyfS3tfgSeBpwCPcBGAYYCw/s640/spencer-models-epic-fail2-628x353.jpg) (from  former NASA scientist Roy Spencer) shows that the IPCC’s models have  overestimated the tropospheric warming. The CAGW-models can be seen to  be irrational and represent the Earth’s climate system so poorly that  they can really only be described as misrepresentations of it. Quote  from Dr. Roy Spencer: “We  can see that 95% of the models have  over-forecast the warming trend  since 1979, whether we use their own  dataset (HADCRUT4) or our satellite  dataset of lower tropospheric  temperatures (UAH)”*.*

I have a genuine question for you all regarding what you’re thinking.,"Can I ask the people of this sub this? You claim there is an agenda of people trying to get us all to “pay more” by taking action on climate change (reducing emissions primarily), but do you ever think about the money that goes into sowing doubt about climate change?

Think about it. You have scientists and some fringe businesses vs every GHG emitting industry on Earth here. Do you seriously think there is a global conspiracy, only involving the world of science, when the far more reasonable viewpoint would be that the industries, that can afford to lobby governments all over the world might have a legitimate reason to make you all think nothing is wrong? 

These companies make actual money from being allowed to emit as much as they do. It costs money to change their course (not to mention involves actually giving a fuck), why do you think no polluting industry wants to? Not to mention, the businesses that want to replace these ones (solar panel manufacturers for instance) are typically longer term investments and don’t rely so much on ongoing income. 

And you look at the political parties that don’t want to do much about these things. Liberal Party of Australia. Backed by mining corporations, both publicly and not. And enjoyed the support of the majority of Australia’s media outlets. 

Clive Palmer even backed these guys, running scare campaigns and attack ads against Labor the entire election with the sole purpose of keeping Labor out. Even ran his party in all 150 seats just to funnel preferences to the Liberals. Election comes and goes, and look at that, Palmer is building a new coal mine in Queensland now. 

Might I add that Labor was running on a vague platform of stopping new coal mining and working toward fixing climate change. There is your actual proof that BIG money goes into convincing the public nothing is wrong with the climate (Palmer spent an estimated $60 million on his ad campaigns). 

Not that Labor is particularly hard on industries either. Backed by mining to a lesser extent, their policy was just 50% reduction in GHG emissions by 2030. Which, with renewables getting better by the day, is realistic. But did they ever get hammered in the media for it. 

Move to the Greens. Member funded (they do not accept corporate donations). Thought that Labor wasn’t going hard enough on climate issues. Opposes Adani’s 1500 job mine (which btw is definitely a significant figure. Queensland only had 10,000 people go unemployed in March alone). Hammered by EVERY media outlet I can think of, and ended up with one seat. Note the pattern here? Smaller the donations from mining, the more they want to do about climate change, and the more they get attacked for it. 

Did I mention the hammering Labor copped for the “carbon tax”? [Because the Liberal Party staffers responsible admitted they were full of shit.](https://www.sbs.com.au/news/carbon-tax-just-brutal-politics-credlin)

Just think who benefits from taking action (supposedly the “left”, a broad category of people that seems to include science and that’s about it), and who benefits from not taking action to reduce emissions (anyone who contributes to higher GHG levels: car manufacturers, coal mining, power generation, farming, any business that relies on clearing land and chopping down forestry, gasoline extractors, oil companies, I could go on). 

And just maybe consider that you all are being misled into questioning imprecise science, not for your own benefit, but for that of the powers that run everything?",0,"I have a genuine question for you all regarding what you’re thinking.

You claim there is an agenda of people trying to get us all to “pay more” by taking action on climate change (reducing emissions primarily), but do you ever think about the money that goes into sowing doubt about climate change?

Think about it. You have scientists and some fringe businesses vs every GHG emitting industry on Earth here. Do you seriously think there is a global conspiracy, only involving the world of science, when the far more reasonable viewpoint would be that the industries, that can afford to lobby governments all over the world might have a legitimate reason to make you all think nothing is wrong? 

These companies make actual money from being allowed to emit as much as they do. It costs money to change their course (not to mention involves actually giving a fuck), why do you think no polluting industry wants to? Not to mention, the businesses that want to replace these ones (solar panel manufacturers for instance) are typically longer term investments and don’t rely so much on ongoing income. 

And you look at the political parties that don’t want to do much about these things. Liberal Party of Australia. Backed by mining corporations, both publicly and not. And enjoyed the support of the majority of Australia’s media outlets. 

Clive Palmer even backed these guys, running scare campaigns and attack ads against Labor the entire election with the sole purpose of keeping Labor out. Even ran his party in all 150 seats just to funnel preferences to the Liberals. Election comes and goes, and look at that, Palmer is building a new coal mine in Queensland now. 

Might I add that Labor was running on a vague platform of stopping new coal mining and working toward fixing climate change. There is your actual proof that BIG money goes into convincing the public nothing is wrong with the climate (Palmer spent an estimated $60 million on his ad campaigns). 

Not that Labor is particularly hard on industries either. Backed by mining to a lesser extent, their policy was just 50% reduction in GHG emissions by 2030. Which, with renewables getting better by the day, is realistic. But did they ever get hammered in the media for it. 

Move to the Greens. Member funded (they do not accept corporate donations). Thought that Labor wasn’t going hard enough on climate issues. Opposes Adani’s 1500 job mine (which btw is definitely a significant figure. Queensland only had 10,000 people go unemployed in March alone). Hammered by EVERY media outlet I can think of, and ended up with one seat. Note the pattern here? Smaller the donations from mining, the more they want to do about climate change, and the more they get attacked for it. 

Did I mention the hammering Labor copped for the “carbon tax”? [Because the Liberal Party staffers responsible admitted they were full of shit.](https://www.sbs.com.au/news/carbon-tax-just-brutal-politics-credlin)

Just think who benefits from taking action (supposedly the “left”, a broad category of people that seems to include science and that’s about it), and who benefits from not taking action to reduce emissions (anyone who contributes to higher GHG levels: car manufacturers, coal mining, power generation, farming, any business that relies on clearing land and chopping down forestry, gasoline extractors, oil companies, I could go on). 

And just maybe consider that you all are being misled into questioning imprecise science, not for your own benefit, but for that of the powers that run everything?"

Global Warming in the West,"We live on the Washington side of the Columbia Gorge, and decided to take a road trip to the national parks and monuments of southern Utah, by way of Ogden, Utah's celebration of the sesquicentennial of the ""Golden Spike"" that completed the first transcontinental railroad.

It was unseasonably cold in most places we went. Absolutely frigid in some of them. The landscape was beautifully and unusually green everywhere, owing to the heavy rain and snow that's fallen almost everywhere west of the Mississippi River except for the Puget Sound region of western Washington.

We are on the way home. Yesterday, we drove from Moab, Utah, which was cold, to Ely, Nevada, which was colder. We hit slush at near the intersection of I-70 and I-15, and awoke to sleet this morning. Now it's snowing, and we saw a Nevada DOT plow this morning. The scenic drive through Great Basin Nat'l Park was mostly closed yesterday due to snow. Today, we will drive to Lakeview, Oregon, in south-central Oregon just over the California border. It should be warm and dry there by now, but we expect it to be chilly and raining. They've had a lot of rain this year.

Remember the permanent California drought? Well, the state's reservoirs are almost full, and more rain and mountain snow is coming. None of what I am describing is unusual in the larger scheme. The West has always had a highly variable and volatile climate -- which is something that the global warming cultists would have known if they'd simply bothered to look at the records and crack open a history book. But no!

There was the permanent drought in Texas early in this decade, and then the permanent drought in California in mid-decade. All caused by global warming, and not the natural drought-drench cycles that characterize these places. When ""progressives"" coalesce around an egregious bullshit story, nothing will dislodge them.

Common sense would dictate that in a round about way we could quite easily and affordably fill places like Australia, China and Africa with forests. Seeds are cheap and essentially it is a single one time investment. The labour would take no more than a couple years reduced if we aerial seed and within a decade or two of growth we'd almost double our absorption.

Why don't we do this?

Obviously because anthropogenic climate change is a money making scam. If we simply threw small amounts of money at it and planted forests we'd essentially break even our Co2 output and hence stop the perceived problem.

Instead all they recommend is related to technology, buy solar, buy wind, buy EV's, buy new efficient houses, buy battery storage, buy buy buy, tax tax tax. Those are the only solutions they push. 

Interesting.

And whenever they do discuss forests its almost always about deforestation and how bad it is and the very little times they ever do speak of reforestation there are always reasons to not do it, but this and but that. Its all bollocks.

Hemp (sure not the best absorber) can grow from seed to fully grown in 12 weeks, its a robust plant that you pretty much scatter and you'll have a hemp forest in no time.

Climate Change and Global Warming,"A while back the warmists changed the term from CAGW to Climate Change. ie. not whether the Earth is warming, and catastrophically at that, but whether the climate is being changed, cold or warm. But they still held onto the cause that they put forward that of human produced CO2 producing catastrophic warming.

The climate is noticeably changing. It's getting colder. The problem is, though, that many people have logically disconnected the climate changing side from the global warming side but are still looking at controlling CO2 to fix it. Which according to warmist science is a scientific and logical fallacy. This disconnect is a big issue.",0,"Climate Change and Global Warming A while back the warmists changed the term from CAGW to Climate Change. ie. not whether the Earth is warming, and catastrophically at that, but whether the climate is being changed, cold or warm.

Excerpt:

The tree-dwelling species has been ravaged by the effects of rising temperatures and heat waves, which have caused widespread deforestation and fatal dehydration in koalas, according to the AKF.

Excerpt:

To me, conflating those two is as self-harming as casually stating ""btw the earth is flat"" 

Please, please, please, DO NOT mix up the Ozone layer crisis with the Climatechange nonsense

Since shills have started targetting this sub and are trying to get it banned, they are going to push narratives portraying people here as ""dangerous"" 

I first ran into such an attempt like 2 or 3 weeks ago, as one such extremist tried ideological gatekeeping on one [of my posts](http://archive.fo/aYxdH):

&gt;Whatever buddy. You made it political with your original comment. I'm a Democrat and also a climate skeptic (we're not all looney toons). It just pisses me off when I come here for information but have to sort through all of the right-wing circle jerking.


I haven't paid much attention to the sub since then, but shills and wannabe gatekeepers act like mushrooms, they never arrive places solo, there's always tons [beneath the surface](https://www.wikihow.com/Kill-Mushrooms)

So, as far as countering their attempts goes
-

The single most important thing is being aware of shilling attempts. This is more important than anything else. 

It doesn't mean ""shill"" accusations being hurled at one another, it means a general awareness. Maybe a stickied post, maybe something in the sidebar, literally anything. 

Also
-

Pre-emptively let's get some good posts and overviews on the general reasons for skepticism so when you reference Climategate, or global cooling, there are some sources to state rather than (falsely) assuming newcomers and lurkers are aware of such arguments 

The narrative shills will try to paint will be something like ""hurr durr I'm a dumb redneck I don't trust science"", and that needs to be countered 

Now then
-

Let me start with some examples of fake news around climate change: here's an archive from March 4th 1970: the idea of a ""man-made, life destroying ice age"" while wasting all of the publics attention on it, while ignoring the f-cking Ozone layer and very real (but hard to observe) CFC's, because [these idiots were obsessed on pushing bureaucratic fuel controls](https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=qvcNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=_3sDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5498,3270345)


&gt;""The possibility of a new

And these same idiots kept all the attention on fuels.

It was only by ACCIDENT someone paid attention to the Ozone layer and non-fuel-based pollutants, and so (ironically) there WAS a massive environmental risk at the time but not with ""global cooling"", the risk was with with the Ozone layers destruction, which no one [paid attention to because the idiots were all pushed to focus on transportation fuels](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/ozone-hole-was-super-scary-what-happened-it-180957775/):

&gt;...Even as researchers began to study ozone levels over time, they started to think about whether it was capable of being depleted. **By the 1970s, they were asking how emissions from things like supersonic aircraft and the space shuttle, which emitted exhaust directly into the stratosphere, might affect the gases at that altitude.**

&gt;But it turned out that contrails weren’t the ozone layer’s worst enemy—the real danger was contained in things like bottles of hairspray and cans of shaving cream. In 1974, a landmark paper showed that chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) used in spray bottles destroy atmospheric ozone. The discovery earned Paul Crutzen, Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland a Nobel Prize, and all eyes turned to the invisible layer surrounding Earth.

&gt;But what they found shocked even scientists who were convinced that CFCs deplete ozone. Richard Farman, an atmospheric scientist who had been collecting data in Antarctica annually for decades, thought his instruments were broken when they began to show drastic drops in ozone over the continent. They weren’t: The ozone layer had been damaged more than scientists could have imagined before Farman discovered the hole.



Also a more recent update, AFTER the Ozone [layer discovery](http://archive.is/S5kU6) and action, they completely flipped from ""cooling"" to ""warming"":



&gt;U.N. Predicts Disaster if Global Warming Not Checked

Jun. 30, 1989


&gt;UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ **A senior U.N. environmental official says entire nations could be wiped off the face of the Earth by rising sea levels if the global warming trend is not reversed by the year 2000.**
Coastal flooding and crop failures would create an exodus of ″eco- refugees,′ ′ **threatening political chaos, said Noel Brown, director of the New York office of the U.N. Environment Program, or UNEP.
He said governments have a 10-year window of opportunity to solve the greenhouse effect before it goes beyond human control.**

&gt;As the warming melts polar icecaps, ocean levels will rise by up to three feet, enough to cover the Maldives and other flat island nations, Brown told The Associated Press in an interview on Wednesday.
Coastal regions will be inundated; one-sixth of Bangladesh could be flooded, displacing a fourth of its 90 million people. A fifth of Egypt’s arable land in the Nile Delta would be flooded, cutting off its food supply, according to a joint UNEP and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency study.
″Ecological refugees will become a major concern, and what’s worse is you may find that people can move to drier ground, but the soils and the natural resources may not support life. Africa doesn’t have to worry about land, but would you want to live in the Sahara?″ he said.

&gt;UNEP estimates it would cost the United States at least $100 billion to protect its east coast alone.
Shifting climate patterns would bring back 1930s Dust Bowl conditions to Canadian and U.S. wheatlands, while the Soviet Union could reap bumper crops if it adapts its agriculture in time, according to a study by UNEP and the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis.

&gt;...**UNEP is working toward forming a scientific plan of action by the end of 1990, and the adoption of a global climate treaty by 1992**. In May, delegates from 103 nations met in Nairobi, Kenya - where UNEP is based - and decided to open negotiations on the treaty next year.
**Nations will be asked to reduce the use of fossil fuels, cut the emission of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases such as methane and fluorocarbons, and preserve the rain forests.**

And now they rebranded yet again to a vague and undefined ""climate change"", because ""global warming"" is getting too much criticism

2. Do you think it’s just a natural trend of the earth or that we are causing it?
3. Do you think there’s no climate change or that there’s just no need to act on it?
4. If you could link me to some scientific articles stating that climate change is false it would be much appreciated!

Thanks!"

Why I'm a skeptic. (Can't find the meme so I'll type the shit out),"70's - Global Cooling was going to kill us

I think the final straw for me at least was if you remember (you might have forgot because the media buried this faster than you can blink) but when the emails came out about the ""scientist"" altering data regarding ""global warming""  I was always skeptical but that was it.

Anyway....that's my 2 cents on this whole deal.

A Note on H2O and CO2,"H2O, in its various forms, has a massive effect on the weather and the climate. Oceans conduct and transfer heat and cold. Snow reflects IR radiation. Humidity stores heat. Clouds keep out heat and keep in heat. The rough ball park figure for the effect of H2O is 100 times that of CO2. However the effect of H2O varies quite considerably. A 25% variation in CO2 corresponds to a 0.25% variation of H2O. ie. if there is an increase or decrease in cloud cover of 0.25% that corresponds to an increase to 500PPM, or a decrease to 300PPM of CO2. The amount of cloud cover is constantly varying and as such makes any increase in CO2 in the order of 100PPM or more completely meaningless and irrelevant.",0,"A Note on H2O and CO2 H2O, in its various forms, has a massive effect on the weather and the climate.

To those of you who provided earnest counter points and verifiable sources of information to substantiate them, thank you. I will read into them before coming to conclusions and take the counter points in mind when I have a chance to challenge a few people who are experts on this subject myself.

The conversation has now reached an end point it seems as every new comment has focused in on the same points and each answer I give has already been given on a different thread of comments. At any rate I apologize that I cannot consume my time with this anymore and another long work week is coming my way.

To those of you who have argued only in Symantecs and feelings; you’re not doing your cause any favors.

To those of you who are just here to insult and be angry; I feel sorry for you. Regardless of whatever the topic is, get yourselves under control.

Maurice Newman was australian prime ministers chief business adviser. In 2015 he wrote an article in an Australian Newspaper stating that “Climate change is a ruse led by the united Nations to create a new world order”.

&amp;#x200B;

Maurice Newman continues and says that the new world order will be run by the United Nations. UN uses false models which show sustained temperature increase because it wants to end democracy and impose authoritarian rule.

&amp;#x200B;

“It’s a well-kept secret, but 95 percent of the climate models we are told prove the link between human CO2 emissions and catastrophic global warming have been found, after nearly two decades of temperature stasis, to be in error. The real agenda is concentrated political authority. Global warming is the hook. UN is against capitalism and wants to create a new world order”.

&amp;#x200B;

This statement was done when UN climate chief Christiana Figueres visited Australia. Newman says that Figueres had also said:

&amp;#x200B;

“Democracy is a poor political system for fighting global warming. Communist China is the best model”.

How do we know that climate change is occuring and we didn't just accidentally forget to count some calender days?,"I'll explain. What if over the past hundred years we skipped two weeks of calender days? For example, let's say on June 20, 1950 we all collectively forgot to mark out calenders and put our calender on a one day delay. This could be forgetting to mark calenders, all of us being asleep for some reason, etc. This seems that it would be a rare occurance, but over one hundred years we could have accumulated two weeks of uncounted calender days putting our calender right now on a two week delay.

This would make all the seasons start and end earlier which would give us the feeling that the climate is changing, when in reality our calenders have just been accumulating longer delays. We could also have accidentally skipped over days which would make seasons start and end later. Either skipping over or forgeting to count calender days could hypothetically make us think that the climate is changing and I have never heard a climate scientist address this point.",0,"How do we know that climate change is occuring and we didn't just accidentally forget to count some calender days?

The Greenhouse Gas That Matters,"Based on physical chemistry and biochemistry we could double our present use of fossil fuel and we would NOT see an increase in atmospheric CO2.......we would only see earth’s total biomass greenery grow faster and larger. CO2 is the fertilizer of life. That is not a problem.  Yes it is a greenhouse gas; however,  its concentration is much too low  to have any significant impact on earth’s heat retention. 

800 ppmv CO2 Greenhouse effect is negligible compare to 40,000 ppmv water vapor (at the equator).  Atmospheric water vapor concentrations is at least 200 ppmv at the polar regions and  increase rapidly in concentration as you move towards the equator.   

You can actually see the amount of atmospheric greenhouse water vapor that occurs in your area. Any rain you witness in your area came directly  from water vapor that condensed into clouds in your area.....that rain came directly from clouds that become too heavy to remain airborne! 

Rain is former greenhouse gas falling from the skies. 

Our planets stay warm 97% due specifically to water vapor......not CO2!!     Water vapor is the only greenhouse gas of concern.  The population has been brainwashed to believe CO2 is a problem.  It is not. 

Think about this:

ALL deserts get cold at night  because there is no water vapor in the air to keep the heat trapped close to the ground. That same dry air will contain 200 ppmv of CO2.........which is not nearly enough to keep heat trapped in the nighttime desert air.  Lack of water vapor alone is what allows desert air to get cold at night.  

Once you recognize this easily verifiable fact, you begin to see the AGW hoax for what it is.......a political mechanism to CONTROL you and carbon tax you to death!!!

Rain is USED greenhouse gas falling from the sky and on the way to be recycled and rejuvenated.  We bear witness to this magnificent event.  

Likewise.....do you see the quadrillion tons of leaves, grasses, and your food   as used greenhouse gas too?  Now which one do see more of?

We’re in a carbon drought.

That is according to Professor William Happer of Princeton University. The renowned physicist says when it comes to carbon dioxide, there’s more good than bad. He goes on to say most of carbon dioxide’s effect has already happened. He points to the logarithmic dependence of temperature on carbon dioxide levels.

Happer says the unique properties of carbon dioxide mean that current levels would need to double for another one-degree increase in temperature and they’d have to double again for another one degree rise.

Atmospheric CO2 concentrations are ALWAYS driven by temperature.....,"Atmospheric CO2 concentrations are ALWAYS driven by temperature.

Try doubling atmospheric CO2 concentration by increasing  emissions from any man caused event  and you will utterly fail.  It cannot be done!  That’s right... it cannot be done!!  Earth’s total biomass and vast oceans and waters will prevent any increase in Atmospheric CO2 CONCENTRATION. 

CO2 gas tonnage MOVEMENT through the atmosphere will definitely increase; however,  the overall CO2 concentration WILL NOT increase!  Doubling our use of fossil fuels will have zero measurable corresponding increase in AGT.  Be happy for this!!!

What happens each spring as earth’s biomass reacts  suddenly and magnificently to a seasonal temperature increase is all the proof one should need to “see”” what I stated above is true and self evident. Remember that atmospheric CO2 does not change its concentration during that spring  time event..........even though a gazzion tons of CO2 moves through the atmosphere and gets immediately locked up in the springtime burst of new plant life........triggered by the seasonal increase in temperature.

The Current Sunspot Minimum: Update,"This article is very interesting because it's an update current conditions. Note that the sunspot minimum ca. 2008 reached a 100 years low. And the current sunspot minimum is on track to do much the same. But time will tell.

What this means about cosmic ray impact upon the earth is important, esp. for space &amp; airliner travel and satellites, is interesting too; and the declining solar wind lets more cosmic rays through, and its a sort of indirect, but reinforcing measure of a solar minimum.

The important point is what the current sunspot minimum is, because they created a new method which overcalls the sunspots by using Ca++ and H+ line images to augment the ""Visual Only"" sunspot recordings back to the 1600's or so. that results in a 20-30 sunspot number overcalling from the previous methods &amp; means that the historical records, unless corrected by that value, are overcalling sunspot numbers, as well.

So time will tell. If we down grade the current SN to historical methods, then we will see if the current minimum, which is approaching a 50 years minimum, is the case. And by downgrading it by that 20-30 SN factor, we can see if the current sunspot cycle is the same, more or less than the previous one.

Those are important data not being seen or reported by the solar observatories, and is critical to understanding our sun and the part it plays in global Warming AND Cooling.

Day Two At The Greenland Open, ,0,Day Two At The Greenland Open  
Some points and arguments I thought of,"-Earth is 4.6 billion years old (4,600,000,000)
Humans have been around for approximately 200,00 years. The industrial revolution (the apparent start of anthropogenic CO2) started approximately 200 years ago from today.

-Primates arose, breathing the same levels of oxygen in similar climate around 85-55 million years ago. But with more co2.

-This means anthropogenic CO2 has only been around for 0.000004347826086956522% of the planet’s timeline 
Or 0.0003636363636363636% of the time since primates arose (using the 55 million liberal estimate).
Or 0.1% of the time since home sapiens came to be.

-Humans apparently emit 38.2 billion tons of CO2 by the burning of fossil fuels (very liberal estimate)
The total CO2 natural planetary output AKA “the carbon cycle – slow and fast” is approximately 700-1000 billion tons but noone really knows. You can google this till your eyeballs are dried out and you will struggle to find the answer, you'll then struggle to confirm the answer and eventually you'll struggle to find out how they came up with the answer. Even “climate scientists” from NASA, IPCC and the EPA find these figures hard to gauge.
This means human output is only 3.8% of the total known output or in other words the natural output is 96.2% 
Of the total co2 that is output the oceans and plants soak up about 45% (including our own) which means that our 38.2 billion output is almost halved to about 20 billion tons.
This means our total atmospheric, non-absorbed co2 is closer to 2% of total co2 emitted
Estimates differ but it is said that volcanoes emit between 100 and 250 million tons of co2 per year.
All of the above equates to around 400ppm in the atmosphere or better put 0.04% And that is the TOTAL of both natural and man made co2. 
It is hard to gauge how much the total man made co2 in the atmosphere is after absorption for obvious reasons however in a vacuum if we look at the total atmosphere being 1 quadrillion that would equate to 0.0038000000000000004%
How exactly is any of this a problem?

-We are told this is a huge problem because our co2 output is cumulative as only some of it is stored naturally and the rest ends up in the atmosphere and it builds up which equates to basically all life on earth slowly boiling away or something end of world like... this is nothing more than a hypothesis and it assumes co2 output and absorption are constants which Is ridiculous as none of these are constants. If this was the case why have hominids and primates been able to exist on this planet for at a time of between 55-85 million years ago when at that very time there was co2 with between 1000-2000 ppm in the atmosphere? 

-back to the ""natural carbon cycle"" it assumes we are not part of the natural cycle. We are spoken about as if we are a kind of virus on the planet. Everything else that emits co2 other than humans is deemed perfectly natural but we humans are the problem in the narrative because of course we must be un-natural. This is again ridiculous and there is zero explanation for it. We are part of the planet. We are natural to it. It assumes the same, that our un-natural output is adding ""more"" co2, but of course that more is only ever explained from a modem time perspective. Believers don't like looking back in time further than the late 1700's.

-climate believers behave as if we are living in the end times, they use alarmist language and essentially it comes across as a wild conspiracy theory. When you tell them they are conspiracy theorists they really don't know how to respond because they aren't used to it. The fact is most of them don't actually believe most of the alarmist garbage themselves it's just comfortable for them to go with the flow but as soon as you call them conspiracy theorists which is what they really are, they get very defensive because they've never thought about this way. One addition to this is asking them if they are completely off-grid and if they have devoted 100% of their waking life to reversing the end times, naturally they say no to which I usually make them confirm if they believe like their comrades do that the world is going to end, by this point most will never return a reply and the ones that do usually try to change the subject because they are realising how silly what they believe is. 

-pollution and co2 output are completely different topics that the believers constantly confuse. Once you tell them your not for pollution, plastic in the ocean is bad, chemicals and pollutants in our air and water are dangerous etc it disarms them to a degree. Most of them have never considered climate sceptics are just as concerned about polluting as the rest of humanity. We all want clean air, water and food. Co2 is not a pollutant. They different topics. Don't ever let a believer conflate the bees with co2. 

-Humans. Time and self destruction. Humans don't have a self destructive program as a collective. Let's say the believers are correct and we've fucked things up. Well let's take a step back. We need to think not on our time scale but on the planets. 200 years is a blip on the planetary time scale. The last one hundred thousand years is part of the last tenth of a second in the planetary clock to midnight and we're led to believe we have made a mess but in that same tiny tiny tiny  frame of time we are correcting it. We've got solar, wind, hydro, Nuclear, it's the topic of discussion constantly, we've created atmospheric carbon cleaners, carbon store injection systems, plastic eating bacteria, we're putting a man on Mars for Pete's sake, we have both super and quantum computers, AI...Guys, I'm pretty sure we're looking after the problem..were the apex predator for a reason.",0,"Some points and arguments I thought of -Earth is 4.6 billion years old (4,600,000,000)

"The Green Agenda - ""The common enemy of humanity is man""","&amp;#x200B;

“*The common enemy of humanity is man.*  
*In searching for a new enemy to unite us, we came up*  
*with the idea that pollution, the threat of global warming,*  
*water shortages, famine and the like would fit the bill. All these*  
*dangers are caused by human intervention, and it is only through*  
*changed attitudes and behavior that they can be overcome.*  
*The real enemy then, is humanity itself.""*  
**- Club of Rome**  


**The First Global Revolution** The environmental movement has been described as the largest and most influential social phenomenon in modern history. From relative obscurity just a few decades ago it has spawned thousands of organisations and claims millions of committed activists. Reading the newspaper today it is hard to imagine a time when global warming, resource depletion, environmental catastrophes and 'saving the planet' were barely mentioned. They now rank among the top priorities on the social, political and economic global agenda.

Environmental awareness is considered to be the mark of any good honest decent citizen. Multi-national companies compete fiercely to promote their environmental credentials and 'out-green' each other. The threat of impending ecological disasters is uniting the world through a plethora of international treaties and conventions. But where did this phenomenon come from, how did it rise to such prominence, and more importantly, where is it going?

While researching for these articles, and during my academic studies, I have come across many references to the [The Club of Rome](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/www.clubofrome.org/) (CoR), and reports produced by them. Initially I assumed that they were just another high-level environmental think-tank and dismissed the conspiracy theories found on many websites claiming that the CoR is a group of global elitists attempting to impose some kind of one world government.

I am not a conspiratorial person by nature and was faced with a dilemma when I first read their reports. But it's all there - in black and white. The CoR claims that ""*we are facing an imminent catastrophic ecological collapse*"" and ""*our only hope is to transform humanity into a global interdependent sustainable society, based on respect and reverence for the Earth*."" In the end I came to the conclusion that there are two possibilities – either the CoR wrote all these reports and setup a vast network of [supporting organisations](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/www.green-agenda.com/greenweb.html) just for fun **or** they actually believe what they have written and are working hard to fulfill their role as the self-appointed saviours of Gaia.

Based on my close observation of their actions, and watching the recommendations made by the CoR many years ago now being adopted as official UN and government policy – well, I have become personally convinced that they are deadly serious. On this website I try to use quotes and excerpts as much as possible and let the reader reach their own conclusions.

So, what exactly is the Club of Rome and who are its members?

# Founded in 1968 at David Rockefeller’s estate in Bellagio, Italy, the CoR describes itself as ""a group of world citizens, sharing a common concern for the future of humanity."" It consists of current and former Heads of State, UN beaureacrats, high-level politicians and government officials, diplomats, scientists, economists, and business leaders from around the globe.

The Club of Rome subsequently [founded](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/www.fondamental.com/en/eclub2.htm) two sibling organizations, the [Club of Budapest](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/www.clubofbudapest.org/index.php) and the [Club of Madrid](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/www.clubmadrid.org/). The former is focused on social and cultural aspects of their agenda, while the latter concentrates on the political aspects. All three of these 'Clubs' share many common members and hold [joint meetings](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/www.fondamental.com/en/eclubbud.htm) and [conferences](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/www.gfna.net/eventdetail.php?id=14&amp;). As explained in other articles on this website it is abundantly clear that these are three heads of the same beast. The CoR has also established a network of 33 [National Associations.](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/www.clubofrome.org/eng/national_associations/addresses.asp) Membership of the 'main Club' is limited to 100 individuals at any one time. Some members, like Al Gore and Maurice Strong, are affiliated through their respective National Associations (e.g. [USACOR](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/www.usacor.org/), [CACOR ](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/www.cacor.ca/)etc).

I would like to start this analysis of the Club of Rome by listing some prominent members of the CoR and its two sub-groups, the Clubs of Budapest and Madrid. Personally it isn’t what the CoR is that I find so astonishing; it is **WHO** the CoR is! This isn’t some quirky little group of green activists or obscure politicians. They are the most senior officials in the United Nations, current and ex-world leaders, and the founders of some of the most influential environmental organisations. When you read their reports in the context of who they are – its gives an entirely new, and frightening, context to their extreme claims.

**Some current members of the Club of Rome or its two siblings:**

***and many more….***

The concept of 'environmental sustainability' was first brought to widespread public attention in 1972 by the Club of Rome in their book entitled [*The Limits to Growth*](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limits_to_Growth). The official summary can be read [here](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/www.clubofrome.org/docs/limits.rtf). The report basically concluded that the growth of the human population, and an increase in prosperity, would cause an ecological collapse within the next hundred years:

“*If the present growth trends in world population, industrialization, pollution, food production, and resource depletion continue unchanged, the limits to growth on this planet will be reached sometime within the next one hundred years. The most probable result will be a rather* ***sudden and uncontrollable decline*** *in both population and industrial capacity*.”

“***It is possible to alter these growth trends*** *and to establish a condition of ecological and economic stability that is sustainable far into the future. The* ***state of global equilibrium could be designed*** *so that the basic material needs of each person on earth are satisfied and each person has an equal opportunity to realize his individual human potential*.”

“*The overwhelming growth in world population caused by the positive birth-rate loop is a recent phenomenon, a result of mankind's very successful reduction of worldwide mortality.* ***The controlling negative feedback loop has been weakened***\*, allowing the positive loop to operate virtually without constraint. There are only two ways to restore the resulting imbalance. Either the birth rate must be brought down to equal the new, lower death rate, or\* ***the death rate must rise again***.”

“***The result of stopping population growth in 1975 and industrial capital growth in 1985*** *with no other changes is that population and capital reach constant values at a relatively high level of food, industrial output and services per person. Eventually, however, resource shortages reduce industrial output and* ***the*** ***temporarily stable state degenerates***.”

“*Man possesses, for a small moment in his history, the most powerful combination of knowledge, tools, and resources the world has ever known. He has all that is physically necessary to* ***create a totally new form of human society*** *- one that would be built to last for generations. The two missing ingredients are a realistic, long-term goal that can* ***guide mankind to the equilibrium society*** *and the Human Will to achieve that goal*.”

“*Without such a goal and a commitment to it, short-term concerns will generate the exponential growth that drives the world system toward the limits of the earth and* ***ultimate collapse***\*. With that goal and that commitment,\* ***mankind would be ready now to begin a controlled, orderly transition from growth to global equilibrium***.”

So as you can see the even back in 1972 the Club considered modern industrial society to be completely unsustainable. They state that even if population was frozen at 1975 levels, and industrial activity at 1985 levels, then the earth’s ecosystems would still ultimately collapse. The CoR has not changed these views in the slightest, in fact, in the last three decades their warnings have become increasingly more urgent and alarmist. They call this imminent collapse the ‘[World Problematique](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/www.clubofrome.org/about/world_problematique.php)’ and their proposed solution the ‘[World Resolutique](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/www.uia.be/en/node/159?kap=24).’

The *Limits to Growth* is considered to be the most successful environmental publication ever produced and propelled the Club of Rome to its current position of an environmental thought-leader and a major consultant to the United Nations. It has been translated into more than forty languages and sold more than 30 million copies. Throughout the 1970s and 80s the concept that humanity was irreparably damaging the earth gained popularity and facilitated the formation of mainstream and activist environmental groups.

All meetings of the CoR are held ‘behind closed doors’ and no public records are kept. However the Club does produce many ‘[discussion reports](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/www.clubofrome.org/archive/reports.php)’ that can be found on its website. The United Nations [contracts](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/erc.unesco.org/ong/en/directory/ONG_Desc_portal.asp?mode=gn&amp;code=908) the Club of Rome to prepare ‘Policy Guidance Documents’ which it uses in formulating its policies and programmes. A quick search for Club of Rome on the [UNESCO publications](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/unesdoc.unesco.org/ulis/cgi-bin/ulis.pl?database=&amp;mode=e&amp;set=47F6CA01_2_151&amp;tx_d=1&amp;look=new&amp;sc1=1&amp;sc2=1&amp;lin=1&amp;nl=1&amp;gp=1&amp;ll=1&amp;scroll=1) site reveals 250 such documents. There are many other documents there authored by CoR members acting in other capacities. As many high ranking UN officials are actually CoR members, this is like a man asking himself for advice, and then agreeing with that advice. Not very objective! Various UN organisations also hold [joint conferences](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=18127&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html) with the CoR.

While checking the Club of Rome website this morning the first item in their ‘current news’ section refers to a briefing delivered by the [CoR to G8 officials ](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/www.clubofrome.org/eng/g8plus5/)in preparation for the upcoming G8 meeting. The second item is a summary report from the Club of Romes ’[strategy planning retreat](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/www.clubofrome.org/eng/cor_news_bank/12/)’ with 150 senior UNESCO officials. The joint CoR/UNESCO communique states:

“*We are at the end of an era – a turning point in history. We are approaching the threshold of runaway climate change.* ***We underline the urgency of radical action to reduce emissions***\*, by both immediate action and longer-term measures; to stress to political leaders the non-linear nature of the processes at work which will generate sudden change; and to assert that the overriding priority must be to avert the impending risk of catastrophic climate change.\*” - CoR/UNESCO communique

Twenty years after the *Limits to Growth* the CoR published another major report that became an instant best-seller. In *The First Global Revolution* the Club of Rome claimed that the time to act had run out. It was now or never. Delay in beginning corrective measures will increase the damage to the world ecological system and ultimately reduce the human population that will eventually be supportable. They also stated that democratic governments are far too short-sighted to deal with the ‘problematique’ and new forms of governance are urgently required.

In order not too violate any copyright protection I will not reproduce the text of the book on this site. However, it is permissible for me to quote a brief excerpt in the context of this wider discussion. The complete [text](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/books.google.com/books?id=8RNKHGbzUuAC&amp;printsec=frontcover) (third ed.) can be read and searched online at Google Books. As you read the following quote (from page 75, first ed.), please remember the names of the leaders listed above. This is not some quirky little cult. This is the [stated agenda ](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/green-agenda.com/index.html)of the leaders of the environmental movement:

“***This is the way we are setting the scene for mankind’s encounter with the planet***\*. The opposition between the two ideologies that have dominated the 20th century has collapsed, forming their own vacuum and leaving nothing but crass materialism.\*

*It is a law of Nature that any vacuum will be filled and therefore eliminated unless this is physically prevented. “Nature,” as the saying goes, “abhors a vacuum.” And people, as children of Nature, can only feel uncomfortable, even though they may not recognize that they are living in a vacuum.* ***How then is the vacuum to be eliminated?***

*It would seem that humans need a common motivation, namely* ***a common adversary***\*, to organize and act together in the vacuum; such a motivation must be found to bring the divided nations together to face an outside enemy,\* ***either a real one or else one invented for the purpose***\*.\*

*New enemies therefore have to be identified.*  
*New strategies imagined, new weapons devised.*

&amp;#x200B;

# ""The common enemy of humanity is man.""

&amp;#x200B;

***In searching for a new enemy to unite us, we came up with the idea that pollution, the threat of global warming, water shortages, famine and the like would fit the bill.*** *All these dangers are caused by human intervention, and it is only through changed attitudes and behavior that they can be overcome.* ***The real enemy then, is humanity itself.***

*The old democracies have functioned reasonably well over the last 200 years, but they appear now to be in a phase of complacent stagnation with little evidence of real leadership and innovation*

***Democracy is not a panacea***\*. It cannot organize everything and it is unaware of its own limits. These facts must be faced squarely. Sacrilegious though this may sound,\* ***democracy*** ***is no longer well suited for the tasks ahead***\*. The complexity and the technical nature of many of today’s problems do not always allow elected representatives to make competent decisions at the right time.\*”

So, long before Global Warming became a well known issue Al Gore and his Club of Rome colleagues stated that they would use the threat of global warming to unite humanity and ""*set the scene for mankind's encounter with the planet.*"" In the same way that shamans and sooth-sayers in medieval times used their advance knowledge of when eclipses would occur to control and terrify their followers, they would use a natural phenomenon as their 'enemy' to achieve their objectives. But then they state that although Global Warming would be presented as the initial enemy, the real enemy of humanity would be portrayed as man himself. I am already noticing how frequently the terms climate change and overpopulation are being uttered in the same breath.

Having discovered that all these influential environmental leaders were associated with the Club of Rome I set about reading all the reports, lectures and speeches on their website as well as the reports commissioned by the UN. I was amazed to find that they lay out their entire agenda for anyone who has eyes to see. Exactly the same themes, concepts and phrases are repeated continuously throughout their publications. They are full of references to '*imminent collapse*', '*dying planet*', '*our mother Gaia*', '*wrenching transformation*', '*united global society*', '*global consciousness*', '*new forms of governance*' etc. They truly intend to bring about the world's *First Global Revolution*.

The [Kosmos Journal ](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/www.kosmosjournal.org/kjo2/about/partners/index.shtml)provides perhaps the best insight into their worldview. This Journal was founded by the Club of Rome in partnership with with several of its sibling organizations. As described in my article, [The Green Web](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/green-agenda.com/greenweb.html), the CoR has established a network of supporting organizations, each focusing on a different aspect of their agenda. The Kosmos Journal contains many articles written by CoR members. The basic premise of their worldview is:

*""Modern industrial civilisation is fast outstripping the Earth's natural regenerative and life-supporting capacity...""*

*""At current rates of resource depletion and environmental degradation a near complete collapse of ecological integrity will occur within the next 100 years...""*

*""Gaia, our Mother, who nutured humanity for countless millenia within her womb of evolution, is dying...""*

*“A small window of opportunity now exists to transform humanity into a sustainable global interdepedant society based on respect and reverence for Earth...""*

*""A radical change from the current trajectory is required, a complete reordering of global society...""*

*""Humans only truly unite when faced with a powerful external enemy...""*

*""At this time a new enemy must be found, one either real or invented for the purpose...""*

*""Democracy has failed us, a new system of global governance, based on environmental imperatives, must be implemented quickly...""*

When Obama was firmly ensconced in the White House the Club of Rome and its affiliates are swing into high gear. The CoR unveiled a new 3-year programme entitled [A New Path for World Development](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/www.clubofrome.org/eng/new_path/). The Club of Madrid has launched the [Road to Copenhagen](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/www.roadtocopenhagen.org/), a joint programme with the UN Environment Programme intended to facilitate a binding global climate change treaty in 2009. Perhaps most interesting is the [State of Global Emergency ](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/www.worldshiftnetwork.org/declaration/index.html)declared by the Club of Budapest in October 2008. The declaration states that we only have **four or five years** to prevent a total collapse of the Earth's ecosystems. To quote from the [document](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/www.worldshiftnetwork.org/media/downloads/declaration.pdf):

“*If we continue on our present unsustainable path,* ***by mid-century the Earth may become largely uninhabitable for human and most other forms of life***\*. Such a total systems collapse could occur much sooner, however, due to\* ***runaway global warming*** *or other ecocatastrophes, and/or by nuclear wars triggered by religious, ethnic or geopolitical conflicts or access to diminishing natural resources. The macro-trends driving these global threats and challenges have been apparent for decades and are now building toward a threshold of irreversibility. The scientific modeling of complex systems shows that when systems reach a state of critical instability, they either break down to their components or break through to a higher order of integral functioning. At these “****points of no return****” maintaining the status quo, or returning to a previous mode of organization and functioning, are not a feasible option.*

*The acceleration of critical trends and cross-impacts among them indicates that the ‘window of opportunity’ for pulling out of the present global crisis and breaking through to a more peaceful and sustainable world is likely to be* ***no more than four to five years*** *from the end of 2008.* ***This is close in time to the Mayan 2012 prophecy for the end of the current world***\*. The period around the end of 2012 is likely to be a turbulent one for this and other reasons. Predictions coming from the physical sciences foresee disturbances in the geomagnetic, electromagnetic and related fields that embed the planet causing significant damage to telecommunications and impacting many aspects of human activity and health.\* ***For the esoteric traditions the end of 2012 will be the end of the known world, although the more optimistic intepretations speak of a new world taking the place of the old***.”

This may seem very strange – a group of prominent world leaders talking about ancient Mayan prophecies, but as I describe in my article, [Gaia's Gurus](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/www.green-agenda.com/gaians.html), many leading global warming activists openly advocate earth-reverence and other New Age philosophies. **Gaia, Global Warming, and Global Governance** are intricately entwined, if one truly believes in Gaia, and that she is being fatally harmed by the current system, then a new system of global governance and control would appear to be the only answer. Global Warming provides the ideal 'enemy' to bring about this objective. It is easy for these global elitists to talk about sacrifice, wrenching transformation, population reduction and eliminating the use of fossil fuels but the implications are truely horrendous.

Even if you think this is all nonsense I would ask you to at least read [these quotes and excerpts](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/green-agenda.com/index.html), and think about the implications of their agenda. Everyday I am amazed at how quickly things are changing. It is coming hard and fast. It's almost like reading a book and then watching the television adaptation, except that this adaptation is not a movie - it's on the evening news. As Al Gore said in the closing sentence of his statement after he won the Nobel Peace Prize ... ""***This is just the beginning***.""

**- Club of Rome**  


**The First Global Revolution** The environmental movement has been described as the largest and most influential social phenomenon in modern history. From relative obscurity just a few decades ago it has spawned thousands of organisations and claims millions of committed activists. Reading the newspaper today it is hard to imagine a time when global warming, resource depletion, environmental catastrophes and 'saving the planet' were barely mentioned. They now rank among the top priorities on the social, political and economic global agenda.

Environmental awareness is considered to be the mark of any good honest decent citizen. Multi-national companies compete fiercely to promote their environmental credentials and 'out-green' each other. The threat of impending ecological disasters is uniting the world through a plethora of international treaties and conventions. But where did this phenomenon come from, how did it rise to such prominence, and more importantly, where is it going?

While researching for these articles, and during my academic studies, I have come across many references to the [The Club of Rome](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/www.clubofrome.org/) (CoR), and reports produced by them. Initially I assumed that they were just another high-level environmental think-tank and dismissed the conspiracy theories found on many websites claiming that the CoR is a group of global elitists attempting to impose some kind of one world government.

I am not a conspiratorial person by nature and was faced with a dilemma when I first read their reports. But it's all there - in black and white. The CoR claims that ""*we are facing an imminent catastrophic ecological collapse*"" and ""*our only hope is to transform humanity into a global interdependent sustainable society, based on respect and reverence for the Earth*."" In the end I came to the conclusion that there are two possibilities – either the CoR wrote all these reports and setup a vast network of [supporting organisations](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/www.green-agenda.com/greenweb.html) just for fun **or** they actually believe what they have written and are working hard to fulfill their role as the self-appointed saviours of Gaia.

Based on my close observation of their actions, and watching the recommendations made by the CoR many years ago now being adopted as official UN and government policy – well, I have become personally convinced that they are deadly serious. On this website I try to use quotes and excerpts as much as possible and let the reader reach their own conclusions.

So, what exactly is the Club of Rome and who are its members?

# Founded in 1968 at David Rockefeller’s estate in Bellagio, Italy, the CoR describes itself as ""a group of world citizens, sharing a common concern for the future of humanity."" It consists of current and former Heads of State, UN beaureacrats, high-level politicians and government officials, diplomats, scientists, economists, and business leaders from around the globe.

The Club of Rome subsequently [founded](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/www.fondamental.com/en/eclub2.htm) two sibling organizations, the [Club of Budapest](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/www.clubofbudapest.org/index.php) and the [Club of Madrid](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/www.clubmadrid.org/). The former is focused on social and cultural aspects of their agenda, while the latter concentrates on the political aspects. All three of these 'Clubs' share many common members and hold [joint meetings](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/www.fondamental.com/en/eclubbud.htm) and [conferences](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/www.gfna.net/eventdetail.php?id=14&amp;). As explained in other articles on this website it is abundantly clear that these are three heads of the same beast. The CoR has also established a network of 33 [National Associations.](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/www.clubofrome.org/eng/national_associations/addresses.asp) Membership of the 'main Club' is limited to 100 individuals at any one time. Some members, like Al Gore and Maurice Strong, are affiliated through their respective National Associations (e.g. [USACOR](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/www.usacor.org/), [CACOR ](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/www.cacor.ca/)etc).

I would like to start this analysis of the Club of Rome by listing some prominent members of the CoR and its two sub-groups, the Clubs of Budapest and Madrid. Personally it isn’t what the CoR is that I find so astonishing; it is **WHO** the CoR is! This isn’t some quirky little group of green activists or obscure politicians. They are the most senior officials in the United Nations, current and ex-world leaders, and the founders of some of the most influential environmental organisations. When you read their reports in the context of who they are – its gives an entirely new, and frightening, context to their extreme claims.

**Some current members of the Club of Rome or its two siblings:**

***and many more….***

The concept of 'environmental sustainability' was first brought to widespread public attention in 1972 by the Club of Rome in their book entitled [*The Limits to Growth*](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limits_to_Growth). The official summary can be read [here](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/www.clubofrome.org/docs/limits.rtf). The report basically concluded that the growth of the human population, and an increase in prosperity, would cause an ecological collapse within the next hundred years:

“*If the present growth trends in world population, industrialization, pollution, food production, and resource depletion continue unchanged, the limits to growth on this planet will be reached sometime within the next one hundred years. The most probable result will be a rather* ***sudden and uncontrollable decline*** *in both population and industrial capacity*.”

“***It is possible to alter these growth trends*** *and to establish a condition of ecological and economic stability that is sustainable far into the future. The* ***state of global equilibrium could be designed*** *so that the basic material needs of each person on earth are satisfied and each person has an equal opportunity to realize his individual human potential*.”

“*The overwhelming growth in world population caused by the positive birth-rate loop is a recent phenomenon, a result of mankind's very successful reduction of worldwide mortality.* ***The controlling negative feedback loop has been weakened***\*, allowing the positive loop to operate virtually without constraint. There are only two ways to restore the resulting imbalance. Either the birth rate must be brought down to equal the new, lower death rate, or\* ***the death rate must rise again***.”

“***The result of stopping population growth in 1975 and industrial capital growth in 1985*** *with no other changes is that population and capital reach constant values at a relatively high level of food, industrial output and services per person. Eventually, however, resource shortages reduce industrial output and* ***the*** ***temporarily stable state degenerates***.”

“*Man possesses, for a small moment in his history, the most powerful combination of knowledge, tools, and resources the world has ever known. He has all that is physically necessary to* ***create a totally new form of human society*** *- one that would be built to last for generations. The two missing ingredients are a realistic, long-term goal that can* ***guide mankind to the equilibrium society*** *and the Human Will to achieve that goal*.”

“*Without such a goal and a commitment to it, short-term concerns will generate the exponential growth that drives the world system toward the limits of the earth and* ***ultimate collapse***\*. With that goal and that commitment,\* ***mankind would be ready now to begin a controlled, orderly transition from growth to global equilibrium***.”

So as you can see the even back in 1972 the Club considered modern industrial society to be completely unsustainable. They state that even if population was frozen at 1975 levels, and industrial activity at 1985 levels, then the earth’s ecosystems would still ultimately collapse. The CoR has not changed these views in the slightest, in fact, in the last three decades their warnings have become increasingly more urgent and alarmist. They call this imminent collapse the ‘[World Problematique](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/www.clubofrome.org/about/world_problematique.php)’ and their proposed solution the ‘[World Resolutique](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/www.uia.be/en/node/159?kap=24).’

The *Limits to Growth* is considered to be the most successful environmental publication ever produced and propelled the Club of Rome to its current position of an environmental thought-leader and a major consultant to the United Nations. It has been translated into more than forty languages and sold more than 30 million copies. Throughout the 1970s and 80s the concept that humanity was irreparably damaging the earth gained popularity and facilitated the formation of mainstream and activist environmental groups.

All meetings of the CoR are held ‘behind closed doors’ and no public records are kept. However the Club does produce many ‘[discussion reports](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/www.clubofrome.org/archive/reports.php)’ that can be found on its website. The United Nations [contracts](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/erc.unesco.org/ong/en/directory/ONG_Desc_portal.asp?mode=gn&amp;code=908) the Club of Rome to prepare ‘Policy Guidance Documents’ which it uses in formulating its policies and programmes. A quick search for Club of Rome on the [UNESCO publications](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/unesdoc.unesco.org/ulis/cgi-bin/ulis.pl?database=&amp;mode=e&amp;set=47F6CA01_2_151&amp;tx_d=1&amp;look=new&amp;sc1=1&amp;sc2=1&amp;lin=1&amp;nl=1&amp;gp=1&amp;ll=1&amp;scroll=1) site reveals 250 such documents. There are many other documents there authored by CoR members acting in other capacities. As many high ranking UN officials are actually CoR members, this is like a man asking himself for advice, and then agreeing with that advice. Not very objective! Various UN organisations also hold [joint conferences](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=18127&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html) with the CoR.

While checking the Club of Rome website this morning the first item in their ‘current news’ section refers to a briefing delivered by the [CoR to G8 officials ](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/www.clubofrome.org/eng/g8plus5/)in preparation for the upcoming G8 meeting. The second item is a summary report from the Club of Romes ’[strategy planning retreat](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/www.clubofrome.org/eng/cor_news_bank/12/)’ with 150 senior UNESCO officials. The joint CoR/UNESCO communique states:

“*We are at the end of an era – a turning point in history. We are approaching the threshold of runaway climate change.* ***We underline the urgency of radical action to reduce emissions***\*, by both immediate action and longer-term measures; to stress to political leaders the non-linear nature of the processes at work which will generate sudden change; and to assert that the overriding priority must be to avert the impending risk of catastrophic climate change.\*” - CoR/UNESCO communique

Twenty years after the *Limits to Growth* the CoR published another major report that became an instant best-seller. In *The First Global Revolution* the Club of Rome claimed that the time to act had run out. It was now or never. Delay in beginning corrective measures will increase the damage to the world ecological system and ultimately reduce the human population that will eventually be supportable. They also stated that democratic governments are far too short-sighted to deal with the ‘problematique’ and new forms of governance are urgently required.

In order not too violate any copyright protection I will not reproduce the text of the book on this site. However, it is permissible for me to quote a brief excerpt in the context of this wider discussion. The complete [text](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/books.google.com/books?id=8RNKHGbzUuAC&amp;printsec=frontcover) (third ed.) can be read and searched online at Google Books. As you read the following quote (from page 75, first ed.), please remember the names of the leaders listed above. This is not some quirky little cult. This is the [stated agenda ](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/green-agenda.com/index.html)of the leaders of the environmental movement:

“***This is the way we are setting the scene for mankind’s encounter with the planet***\*. The opposition between the two ideologies that have dominated the 20th century has collapsed, forming their own vacuum and leaving nothing but crass materialism.\*

*It is a law of Nature that any vacuum will be filled and therefore eliminated unless this is physically prevented. “Nature,” as the saying goes, “abhors a vacuum.” And people, as children of Nature, can only feel uncomfortable, even though they may not recognize that they are living in a vacuum.* ***How then is the vacuum to be eliminated?***

*It would seem that humans need a common motivation, namely* ***a common adversary***\*, to organize and act together in the vacuum; such a motivation must be found to bring the divided nations together to face an outside enemy,\* ***either a real one or else one invented for the purpose***\*.\*

*New enemies therefore have to be identified.*  
*New strategies imagined, new weapons devised.*

&amp;#x200B;

# ""The common enemy of humanity is man.""

&amp;#x200B;

***In searching for a new enemy to unite us, we came up with the idea that pollution, the threat of global warming, water shortages, famine and the like would fit the bill.*** *All these dangers are caused by human intervention, and it is only through changed attitudes and behavior that they can be overcome.* ***The real enemy then, is humanity itself.***

*The old democracies have functioned reasonably well over the last 200 years, but they appear now to be in a phase of complacent stagnation with little evidence of real leadership and innovation*

***Democracy is not a panacea***\*. It cannot organize everything and it is unaware of its own limits. These facts must be faced squarely. Sacrilegious though this may sound,\* ***democracy*** ***is no longer well suited for the tasks ahead***\*. The complexity and the technical nature of many of today’s problems do not always allow elected representatives to make competent decisions at the right time.\*”

So, long before Global Warming became a well known issue Al Gore and his Club of Rome colleagues stated that they would use the threat of global warming to unite humanity and ""*set the scene for mankind's encounter with the planet.*"" In the same way that shamans and sooth-sayers in medieval times used their advance knowledge of when eclipses would occur to control and terrify their followers, they would use a natural phenomenon as their 'enemy' to achieve their objectives. But then they state that although Global Warming would be presented as the initial enemy, the real enemy of humanity would be portrayed as man himself. I am already noticing how frequently the terms climate change and overpopulation are being uttered in the same breath.

Having discovered that all these influential environmental leaders were associated with the Club of Rome I set about reading all the reports, lectures and speeches on their website as well as the reports commissioned by the UN. I was amazed to find that they lay out their entire agenda for anyone who has eyes to see. Exactly the same themes, concepts and phrases are repeated continuously throughout their publications. They are full of references to '*imminent collapse*', '*dying planet*', '*our mother Gaia*', '*wrenching transformation*', '*united global society*', '*global consciousness*', '*new forms of governance*' etc. They truly intend to bring about the world's *First Global Revolution*.

The [Kosmos Journal ](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/www.kosmosjournal.org/kjo2/about/partners/index.shtml)provides perhaps the best insight into their worldview. This Journal was founded by the Club of Rome in partnership with with several of its sibling organizations. As described in my article, [The Green Web](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/green-agenda.com/greenweb.html), the CoR has established a network of supporting organizations, each focusing on a different aspect of their agenda. The Kosmos Journal contains many articles written by CoR members. The basic premise of their worldview is:

*""Modern industrial civilisation is fast outstripping the Earth's natural regenerative and life-supporting capacity...""*

*""At current rates of resource depletion and environmental degradation a near complete collapse of ecological integrity will occur within the next 100 years...""*

*""Gaia, our Mother, who nutured humanity for countless millenia within her womb of evolution, is dying...""*

*“A small window of opportunity now exists to transform humanity into a sustainable global interdepedant society based on respect and reverence for Earth...""*

*""A radical change from the current trajectory is required, a complete reordering of global society...""*

*""Humans only truly unite when faced with a powerful external enemy...""*

*""At this time a new enemy must be found, one either real or invented for the purpose...""*

*""Democracy has failed us, a new system of global governance, based on environmental imperatives, must be implemented quickly...""*

When Obama was firmly ensconced in the White House the Club of Rome and its affiliates are swing into high gear. The CoR unveiled a new 3-year programme entitled [A New Path for World Development](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/www.clubofrome.org/eng/new_path/). The Club of Madrid has launched the [Road to Copenhagen](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/www.roadtocopenhagen.org/), a joint programme with the UN Environment Programme intended to facilitate a binding global climate change treaty in 2009. Perhaps most interesting is the [State of Global Emergency ](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/www.worldshiftnetwork.org/declaration/index.html)declared by the Club of Budapest in October 2008. The declaration states that we only have **four or five years** to prevent a total collapse of the Earth's ecosystems. To quote from the [document](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/www.worldshiftnetwork.org/media/downloads/declaration.pdf):

“*If we continue on our present unsustainable path,* ***by mid-century the Earth may become largely uninhabitable for human and most other forms of life***\*. Such a total systems collapse could occur much sooner, however, due to\* ***runaway global warming*** *or other ecocatastrophes, and/or by nuclear wars triggered by religious, ethnic or geopolitical conflicts or access to diminishing natural resources. The macro-trends driving these global threats and challenges have been apparent for decades and are now building toward a threshold of irreversibility. The scientific modeling of complex systems shows that when systems reach a state of critical instability, they either break down to their components or break through to a higher order of integral functioning. At these “****points of no return****” maintaining the status quo, or returning to a previous mode of organization and functioning, are not a feasible option.*

*The acceleration of critical trends and cross-impacts among them indicates that the ‘window of opportunity’ for pulling out of the present global crisis and breaking through to a more peaceful and sustainable world is likely to be* ***no more than four to five years*** *from the end of 2008.* ***This is close in time to the Mayan 2012 prophecy for the end of the current world***\*. The period around the end of 2012 is likely to be a turbulent one for this and other reasons. Predictions coming from the physical sciences foresee disturbances in the geomagnetic, electromagnetic and related fields that embed the planet causing significant damage to telecommunications and impacting many aspects of human activity and health.\* ***For the esoteric traditions the end of 2012 will be the end of the known world, although the more optimistic intepretations speak of a new world taking the place of the old***.”

This may seem very strange – a group of prominent world leaders talking about ancient Mayan prophecies, but as I describe in my article, [Gaia's Gurus](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/www.green-agenda.com/gaians.html), many leading global warming activists openly advocate earth-reverence and other New Age philosophies. **Gaia, Global Warming, and Global Governance** are intricately entwined, if one truly believes in Gaia, and that she is being fatally harmed by the current system, then a new system of global governance and control would appear to be the only answer. Global Warming provides the ideal 'enemy' to bring about this objective. It is easy for these global elitists to talk about sacrifice, wrenching transformation, population reduction and eliminating the use of fossil fuels but the implications are truely horrendous.

Even if you think this is all nonsense I would ask you to at least read [these quotes and excerpts](https://archive.fo/o/mGpp/green-agenda.com/index.html), and think about the implications of their agenda. Everyday I am amazed at how quickly things are changing. It is coming hard and fast. It's almost like reading a book and then watching the television adaptation, except that this adaptation is not a movie - it's on the evening news. As Al Gore said in the closing sentence of his statement after he won the Nobel Peace Prize ... ""***This is just the beginning***.""

Did anyone else see the guy on unpopularopinion calling for literal genocide on behalf of fighting climate change?,"The most [bizarre thing](http://archive.is/w8guC): 

&gt;If I'm going to uphold my framework of morality, I suppose an impartial genocide would be best. An unbiased draft, so to speak, blind to socioeconomic status, race, gender, everything. Should that theoretical selection include me, then yeah, I'd give up my life to maintain the Earth's ecology. I'm just one insignificant speck in a sea of biology after all.

Anyways I think it's obvious that this mans targets are coincidentally going to be some sort of ""kulak"" group, or ""privileged class"", rather than the rapidly growing demographics of the world 

He mirrored the strategy of Emmanual Macron, by alluding to high African birthrates being a problem, then moving past that and neglecting to criticize migration/displacement

&gt;Unfortunately, fertility rates are usually positively correlated with poverty. Lack of access to proper contraceptives - or lack of means to afford them - result in unprotected sex. That's why the fertility rate table is littered with developing African nations, such as Angola, Burundi, Niger, Somalia, Burkina Faso, and so forth.

&gt;In fact, the first thirty four nations with the highest fertility rate are located in Africa. #35 is Iraq.

Again, on paper this seems ""edgy"" but it's not because Emmanual ""allyourmigrantsarebelongtous"" said [something similar](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/macron-scrutinized-for-blaming-africas-poverty-on-high-birthrate-23897)

&gt;...In response a question on Africa’s needs by a reporter at the G20 Summit July 7, Macron said, “it’s by a more rigorous governance, a fight against corruption, a fight for good governance, a successful demographic transition when countries today have seven or eight children per woman.”

To be clear, Macron is the most fanatical supporter of these [""bombshell"" birthrates](https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2018/04/17/macron-europe-migration-destiny-africa/)

&gt;‘Bombshell’ population growth in Africa means Europe is entering an “unprecedented” age of mass migration, Emmanuel Macron has said, asserting that the two continents’ destinies are “bound”.

And when I say this I mean 0 hate to people of African descent 

Macron isn't your friend, he doesn't want to empower you, he looks down on you and wants you as a subservient class that can be enslaved to an even more kleptocratic state, [nothing more](https://www.france24.com/en/20190122-italy-france-macron-salvini-dimaio-migrants-colonies-africa-libya)

&gt;Gloves off as Italy's populists mount assault on 'coloniser' France

&gt;...Officials in Paris have been getting used to the radical change of tone ushered in by the new populist and increasingly Eurosceptic government in Rome, generally greeting its provocations with a shrug and a sigh. But when Italy’s deputy prime minister, Luigi Di Maio, accused France of continuing to colonise Africa in a series of incendiary comments on Sunday, the provocation had gone too far for the French government, which summoned Italy’s ambassador in protest.

&gt;Di Maio, the leader of the anti-establishment Five-Star Movement, had called on the EU to “sanction France and all countries like France that impoverish Africa and make these people leave, because Africans should be in Africa, not at the bottom of the Mediterranean"". He added: ""If people are leaving today it's because European countries, France above all, have never stopped colonising dozens of African countries.""

Regardless, the reason I point that out is because I just can tell that the OP of that post is thinking about targetting demographically struggling nations (whether of the Western world, or the Oriental nations)

There is no need for ANYONE of any race to be targetted for genocide 

I tried to explain to this extremist how mass migration, etc, all must enable and exponentially worsen climate change, and yet this literally genocide inciting fellow [did not respond](https://np.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/bfjndp/this_planet_needs_a_genocide_and_it_would_be/elepgo5/)

Something Extraordinary with The Last Major Sunspot,"As many know there has been a singular, medium sized sunspot which started earlier this month in the high northern latitudes, which marked it as being sunspot cycle 24. As time went on, then it successively went further and further south, until it Crossed the equator and moved into the Southern hemisphere, very clearly!!!

By doing successive comparisons processing we can see this development, which creates information.

Now THAT is interesting &amp; NOT reported by NOAA. Which of itself is quite perplexing.

By reviewing the sequences of these images, starting about 15 April we can follow this sunspot as it migrates from higher northern sun latitudes to the equator and then very clearly, recently into the Southern latitudes.

Questions for skeptics,"So, i am too a skeptic of climate change and everything else in the world. But i have a few questions for the more informed of you.

Smog is caused by pollution and gasses from cars and other vehicles. So then we still have to fight for less usage of fossil fuels. And for more engines powered by electricity. 

And for Europeans especially, we get most of our oil from the middle east, and would rather have no dependence on that countries. So therefore its only good to have other forms of energy than oils.

My last question is, if humans have no effect or very little effect on climate change, who is benefiting from the rhetoric? Shell and other companies are one of the most wealthy companies ever. They dont want to lose their part.",0,"Questions for skeptics So, i am too a skeptic of climate change and everything else in the world. But i have a few questions for the more informed of you.

18th century philosopher Edmund Burke meditated on how extreme weather affected people emotionally,"He says a few things in this [short Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvzG_p_sdOQ) ([snapshot](https://i.imgur.com/VkaQLfa.jpg)) , starting with:

&gt;Normally we hate being made to feel small, we can't stand being humbled and reminded of our insignificance. We get affronted and resentful.

Burke thought these experiences could be quite important ... he called natural events that made people feel insignificant 'sublime'.   He argued big storms helped make people happier in the long run. Because

&gt;in comparison to a big storm the irritants of daily life seem less significant

my opinion is, being a skeptic and not trying the control the temperature of the planet to a fraction of a degree is healthy. As is being humbled by Nature.

Also in my opinion, being an climate alarmist often involves an unhealthy narcissism; That Burke was onto something relevant;  that some alarmists are a people wanting to avoid being humbled; Their intuition tells them to restrict weather as much as possible (not that they are going to, its just that they think they are), so other people won't be either.

Humans contribute only 0.18% of the greenhouse effect,"I'm surprised that this info about the human contribution to the greenhouse effect is so little discussed. It seems this matter is controversial, because people are offering objections recently.

Well, let's settle this matter in this discussion. Previous discussion is already being redirected into a subthread because of the length.

Here I'm continuing from the previous discussion,
https://www.reddit.com/r/climateskeptics/comments/bdycrw/in_search_of_explanations/

the subthread is here,

https://www.reddit.com/r/climateskeptics/comments/bdycrw/in_search_of_explanations/el5lbmy/

This is what I originally said,

“Only 3.62 percent of the greenhouse gases is CO2. Of that amount, only 5% is emitted by human activity. So humans contribute only 0.18% of the greenhouse effect! This is so tiny that it's virtually invisible.”

Previously, I've given the following ref for my statement,

A Global Warming Primer - National Center for Policy Analysis
http://www.ncpathinktank.org/pdfs/Global-Warming-Primer-updated-reduced-size.pdf

But apparently this was challenged.

So here's my reply to user/Discoastermusicus reposted,

--------------

&gt; Nowhere does it say 3.62% of the greenhouse gases are CO2.

OK, now I have a better ref. Here it is,

https://www.geocraft.com/WVFossils/greenhouse_data.html

&gt; C02 is the second most abundant greenhouse gas if you include water vapor (https://cdiac.ess-dive.lbl.gov/pns/current_ghg.html), but it's misleading to give it as such a specific percentage, because water vapor in the atmosphere is very variable, ranging from 0.01-4.24%

Well, obviously we're talking about the averages here. On average that's how much it is.

&gt;Leaving aside the exact number, anthropogenic C02 emissions are indeed a small fraction of the total carbon flux on the planet

No, I'm not talking about ""the total carbon flux on the planet"". What I'm talking about is the total __greenhouse gas concentrations__.

Here's a quote from my new source,

https://www.geocraft.com/WVFossils/greenhouse_data.html

&gt;""Anthropogenic (man-made) CO2 additions comprise (11,880 / 370,484) or 3.207% of all greenhouse gas concentrations, (ignoring water vapor).""

You quoted further,

&gt;""The late-twentieth-century warming can only be reproduced in the model with anthropogenic forcing (mainly GHGs), while the early twentieth-century warming is mainly caused by natural forcing in the model (mainly solar)."" 

Well, there seems to be a bit of a contradiction here. So the early twentieth-century warming is caused by the sun, but the late-twentieth-century warming “can only be reproduced in the model with anthropogenic forcing”?

So where did the sun go? Did it suddenly decide to take a break in the late-twentieth-century? “I've had enough warming the earth, let the humans now do it!”

Doesn't seem to make much sense.

And just because your “model” says something, or doesn't say something – sorry, but this doesn't amount to much. So if your model refuses to cooperate, perhaps you should get yourself a different model that's closer to reality.

Have I got this right - more Co2 means more heat is trapped each day?,"Greenhouse gas absorbs radiation from the sun.

The whole premise of global warming is that reflected radiation from the earth (land and sea) gets absorbed by Co2 and then re-radiated back down to earth, as well as heating the atmosphere. 

**Is this correct?** 

If so, then wouldn't the difference between the daily minimum and daily maximum be going down over time - as a trend? 

&amp;#x200B;

In other words, if we start with the minimum temperature at say around 5,00am as the sun rises and rays start hitting the earth, radiation gets absorbed. More Co2 will mean more heat is absorbed and re-radiated back. Therefore we should constantly be getting higher daily maximum temperatures, whilst minimums should remain the same. 

&amp;#x200B;

But, here's the problem - the minimums are going up as well.

&amp;#x200B;

With well over 40 years of data to analyse, it should be pretty easy to work out if more heat is being trapped each day. I know i could probably do it using a BI tool quite easily. 

**Have I missed something?**

Sceptical of climate models,"After having read some Ipcc reports, if seems that much of the ""proof"" for the postulated high climate sensitivity to co2 hinges on parameter studies of climate models to temperature data going back only to the start of satellite records around 1978.

Having worked with fitting simulators to online data professionally, the climate model approach irks me on many levels. 

1. there is no clear separation between tuninig and validation datasets. 

2. gisp2 data going back 10000 years indicate that the dominant natural climate cycle having a 1000 year period, fitting of models should ideally be to at least one full period, so 1000 years, not 50 years of data.

3. if the recent 50 years have been part of a natural warming cycle, models which do not describe the 1000 year cycle in its structure will when tuned to data of recent warming inadvertently have parameters that are ""colored"" to favor warming.

4. models seem too complex when the aim is to study the relation between gmt and co2, when there is essentially one model output and a handful of significant inputs, a 3D model whose code fills 18000 pages likely is overparametrized, which may give poorer prediction capabilities than a model with fewer parameters in general.

5. Climate models are surprisingly not automatically tuned (probably because they are too complex) This is a big red flag if true. 

6. Researchers know that models have structural errors, i. e. important observed phenomena are not described correctly, such as cloud formation, yet the model is still used as basis for policy.

7. Backtesting of data is often neglected, or the implication of poor backtest performance is not appreciated
8. A general disinterest in paleoclimate because models are too complex to backtest against sparse proxy data (then maybe your model is too complex?) 


Personally I would very much like to see much simpler lumped (1D) models attempt to describe co2 and temperature proxy data for the last 10000 years, and see what co2 sensitivity such models find,I would actually trust the predictions of such a model far more than the pseudoscience of current climate models. Anyone aware of any such studies? 

I would trust more a 3D-climate model that were able to describe natural variability in paleoclimate temperature proxies. Anyone aware of any such studies? 

Ideally I would appreciate an open discussion with someone knowledgeable in the field, but I fear that practicioners are too invested in their method to be able to review it critically, and that anyone not working in the field will be subject to gatekeeping.

Remember, Arctic sea ice is one of their babies and they pretend 1979-2012 has nothing to do with the AMO etc. ...

The British perspective.,"How the BBC exaggerate man-made global warming in the David Attenborough propaganda program!!

Even the IPCC admits that man-made warming in the last 70 years is only 0.3° C !!!!



Last year, the BBC issued guidelines instructing editors that inviting comment from ‘climate change deniers’ was ‘false balance’. In practice, this has meant that those who accept climate change is real, but less threatening than some such as Attenborough claim, have effectively been banished from the airwaves.
Now the Corporation has given acres of airtime to protesters demanding the overthrow of democratic governments and an almost immediate end to fossil fuel-derived power, heating and transport – in other words, the abrupt termination of civilisation as we know it.
Thunberg has become a global media darling, her pronouncements cherished as if they were holy writ. 
‘I want you all to panic,’ she told the Davos economic forum in January: and Attenborough’s film may well have persuaded viewers to do just that – and, perhaps, to join the Extinction Rebellion barricades. 

Watching it did fill me with horror, but not at the threat from global warming. It was at the way Sir David and the BBC presented a picture of the near future which was so much more frightening than is justified.
Climate science remains a field riven by deep uncertainties. The film largely glossed over these – and where faced with alternatives, it plumped unerringly for the most pessimistic version of the ‘truth’.
Let me be clear: I am not a ‘denier’. Global warming and climate change are real, in large measure caused by humans. According to the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), our emissions were responsible for more than half the 0.6C – 0.7C global average temperature rise recorded between 1951 and 2010.
But I am also convinced that the ‘panic’ Thunberg desires and Attenborough’s film will encourage is not helpful when it comes to making policy designed to tackle it. Moreover, it is a grotesque travesty of the truth to claim that ‘nothing’ has been done: for example, since 1990, UK emissions have fallen by 43 per cent, according to the Government’s Committee on Climate Change. Not only that, Government statistics say 56 per cent of our electricity came from low carbon sources in 2018, our last coal-fired power station will close in six years and the Government has pledged to ‘decarbonise’ electricity by 2030.
Above all, the Climate Change Act requires Britain to reduce its 1990 carbon emissions by no less than 80 per cent by the year 2050, making us the first major economy to make such a dramatic commitment. To say that ‘nothing’ has been done is as risible as it is dishonest.

The IPCC, regarded by mainstream scientists as the world’s most authoritative source, says there have been some changes, such as higher rainfall. But its Fifth Assessment Report, published in 2013, stated there are ‘no significant observed trends in global tropical cyclone frequency over the past century’. It added: ‘No robust trends in annual numbers of tropical storms, hurricanes and major hurricane counts have been identified over the past 100 years in the North Atlantic basin.’
A separate IPCC report last year said that cyclones in the tropics would in future be less numerous, although some would be stronger.
In 2014, a group of IPCC experts published a paper about flooding. So far, they said, ‘no gauge-based evidence has been found for a climate-driven, globally widespread change in the magnitude/frequency of floods.’
Another memorable segment of the film showed a father and son narrowly escaping from one of several devastating fires last year in California. These, too, were ascribed to global warming. Surprisingly, several recent scientific papers suggest that wildfires have been declining in recent years – even in California, where statistics gathered by the local agency, Calfires, says the number across the state has roughly halved since 1987, following a peak in the 1970s.
According to a study published by the Royal Society in 2016, ‘many consider wildfire as an accelerating problem’. In reality, however, says the study: ‘global area burned appears to have declined in past decades, and there is increasing evidence that there is less fire in the global landscape than centuries ago.’",0,"The British perspective.

"""Climate Change"" is Bullshit. Human CO2 Emissions Have Little Effect on Atmospheric CO2"," 

The United Nations *Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change*   (IPCC) agrees human CO2 is only (approximately) 5 percent and natural  CO2 is 95 percent of the CO2 inflow into the atmosphere. The ratio of  human to natural CO2 in the atmosphere must equal the ratio of the  inflows. Yet IPCC claims human CO2 has caused all the rise in  atmospheric CO2 above 280 ppm, which is now 130 ppm or 32 percent of  today’s atmospheric CO2.

To cause the  human 5 percent to become 32 percent in the atmosphere,  the IPCC model  treats human and natural CO2 differently, which is impossible because  the molecules are identical. IPCC’s Bern model artificially traps human  CO2 in the atmosphere while it lets natural CO2 flow freely out of the  atmosphere.

By contrast, a simple  Physics Model treats all CO2 molecules the same, as it should, and shows  how CO2 flows through the atmosphere and produces a balance level where  outflow equals inflow. Thereafter, if inflow is constant, level remains  constant.

The Physics Model has only  one hypothesis, that outflow is proportional to level. The Physics Model  exactly replicates the 14C data from 1970 to 2014 with only two  physical parameters: balance level and e-time. The 14C data trace how  CO2 flows out of the atmosphere.

The  Physics Model shows the 14CO2 e-time is a constant 16.5 years. Other  data show e-time for 12CO2 is about 4 to 5 years. IPCC claims human CO2  reduces ocean buffer capacity. But that would increase e-time. The  constant e-time proves IPCC’s claim is false.

IPCC  argues that the human-caused reduction of 14C and 13C in the   atmosphere prove human CO2 causes all the increase in atmospheric CO2.   However, numbers show these isotope data support the Physics Model and   reject the IPCC model.

The Physics  Model shows how inflows of human and natural CO2 into the  atmosphere  set balance levels proportional to their inflows. Each balance level  remains constant if its inflow remains constant. Continued constant CO2  emissions do not add more CO2 to the atmosphere. No CO2 accumulates in  the atmosphere.

Present human CO2  inflow produces a balance level of about 18 ppm. Present natural CO2  inflow produces a balance level of about 392 ppm. Human CO2 is  insignificant to the increase of CO2 in the atmosphere.  Increased  natural CO2 inflow has increased the level of CO2 in the  atmosphere.

The Climate Change Agenda,"We all know that trying to connect anything to the Climate Change Agenda that has to do with power grabs or depopulation is just a wacky conspiracy theory, but hear me out and let's take a little walk on the wild side......

Every  day, in meetings at all levels of government, representatives of Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), planning groups, and federal agents surround elected representatives and insist that their policies have nothing to do with international agendas. They regularly publish reports and rail against anyone even mentioning the names Agenda 21 or the new Agenda 2030. “No, no, no,” they insist. “Those people are just  crazy conspiracy theorists. Ours is just a local plan for our community.”

Elected Representatives are often confused. Issues and policies suddenly appear in front of them with sample, ready-made  legislation. And then the unending pressure begins for them to pass it. There is confusion, uncertainty and there is the herd mentality to pass legislation. And it’s passed without knowledge of its origins, its  purpose, and especially a lack of understanding of its consequences.  

What most of these legislators fail to understand is the direct  relationship much of this legislation has with a much larger agenda.  Most legislation interconnects with other pieces and parts contained in other legislation. 

&amp;#x200B;

### I. Global Warming/Climate Change

It has been so discredited in the true scientific community that proponents have become almost hysterical in their continued attempts to enforce Climate Change policy. Most recently the Justice Department is considering legal action against “deniers.”  Why don’t they stop, even to question if their science is sound? They instead use great energy to attack any scientist who does dare ask questions or finds data contrary to the “official” line. Why is it so vitally important that they  continue to promote something that clearly is, to say the least, questionable?

It’s because all of Agenda 21 policy is built on the premise that man is  destroying the Earth. Climate Change is their “proof.” To eliminate that premise is to remove all credibility and purpose for their entire agenda. They are willing to go to any length, even lies, to keep the climate change foot on our throats.

On the local level this translates into planning policy that controls energy use and the efforts to cut down on the use of cars, enforcement of the building of  expensive light rail train systems and bike paths and installation of smart meters, etc.

But don’t take my word for it. I’ll let them speak for themselves:

**“No matter if the science of global warming is all phony…climate change  provides the greatest opportunity to bring about justice and equality in the world.”** ***Christine Stewart (Former Canadian Minister of the Environment)*** 

**“We’ve got to ride this global warming issue. Even if the theory of global  warming is wrong, we will be doing the right thing in terms of economic  and environmental policy.”** ***Timothy Wirth (President, UN Foundation)***

**“It doesn’t matter what is true. It only matters what people believe is true.”** ***Paul Watson (Co-Founder of Green Peace.)***

### II. Fear of over population

Fear is the central driving force behind nearly every Sustainable policy initiative. It’s the real force behind Stack and Pack Smart Growth cities.

The fact is, in developed nations populations are actually going down. The only real growth in the US population in recent years has been from immigration, legal or otherwise. Open border immigration policy is actually implementation of Agenda 21 as part of the drive to destroy national sovereignty and “nation states.”

Environmentalists insist that the borders must be open to allow as many to immigrate here as possible. They argue that the U.S. has a greater ability to control them and protect the environment than if we left them in third world  countries. That’s because the Greens already have a stranglehold over our nation’s industry through massive environmental regulations.

In the face of their fear of overpopulation, however, studies have shown that there is no world wide over population crisis. In fact one study insists that we could put the entire population of the world in an area the size of Texas with a population density of Paris, France. Over population, and its accompanying environmental degradation, is a problem primarily in countries where the poor are deprived by government to improve their conditions. Nations that refuse to legalize private property ownership for the masses, for example, are a primary reason for growing poverty.

Meanwhile, Sustainablists work to keep these nations from developing or increasing energy use, thereby keeping them poor. Green regulations stop the building of infrastructure. They panic at the idea of increased energy use in developing nations. Instead of  working to solve the real problems—the root of poverty- they exploit the excuse of over population and advocate enforcing polices to drastically reduce populations. China’s brutal one child policy of forced abortions and sterilization has become their model.

Do you think I’m joking? Then consider these quotes from the Sustainablists:

**“Childbearing should be a punishable crime against society, unless the parents hold a government license. All potential parents should be required to use contraceptive chemicals, the government issuing antidotes to citizens chosen for childbearing.”** ***David Brower (Sierra Club)***

**“A reasonable estimate for an industrialized world society at the present  North American material standard of living would be 1 billion. At a more  frugal European standard of living, 2 to 3 billion would be possible.”** ***United Nations Global Biodiversity Assessment.***

### III. The destruction of the free market system.

We have heard statement after statement from the UN; from members of  Congress; the news media; and from Hollywood, all deriding the free market system as evil, corrupt and a tool of the rich to hold down the poor. So now, after deciding that the poor are expendable for the sake of stopping overpopulation, suddenly the planners are worried about them—if it leads to their ability to raid our bank accounts. So are they  really worried about protecting the environment—or are they actually honoring the tactics of Jesse James?

Redistribution of wealth is  behind every policy that comes out of the UN, and looking back at the Obama Administration as well. The EPA is the attack dog to shut down entire industries like coal. It has become very difficult to operate a  manufacturing business in the US, and nearly impossible to start a new one. Environmental protection is always the excuse. 

At the UN’s Rio + 20 Summit held in 2012, **the idea of “Zero Economic Growth” was  advocated** \- just to keep things fair. It was stated that even the  building of new roads upsets the status quo and disrupts a well ordered society. Such idiotic ideas are the driving force behind Sustainable Development. Again, images of the Dark Ages come to mind.

Yet,  consider “local” planning programs that cut off access roads, and again,  discourage cars. What about the EPA’s war on industry. Pretty hard to have economic growth without industry. The timber industry is killed and  communities die. Dams are torn down and farmers disappear. Zero Economic Growth in the making. Just local?

Again, not my words, let them tell you themselves:

**“We must make this an insecure and inhospitable place for capitalists and  their projects. We must reclaim the roads and plowed lands, halt dam  construction, tear down existing dams, free shackled rivers and return to wilderness millions of acres of presently settled land.”** ***Dave Foreman, (Earth First).***

**“Global sustainability requires the deliberate quest of poverty, reduced  resource consumption and set levels of mortality control”** ***Professor Maurice King (Population Control Advocate)***

**“We believe planning should be a tool for allocating resources…and  eliminating the great inequalities of wealth and power in our society…  because the free market has proven itself incapable of doing this.”** [*Plannersnetwork.org*](http://plannersnetwork.org/) ***Statement of Principles. the American Planning Association is a member and supporter of these principles.***  

### IV. Cheap Energy is the enemy of the Earth.

To the average person the drive to stop any ability to obtain cheap energy  makes no sense. People are hurting economically. Jobs are lost. Energy costs are skyrocketing. Any attempt to drill oil, fracking of shale gas, and mining coal are all vigorously blocked by government and green policy. Yet the government spends billions of dollars on “alternative  energy” such as wind and solar, which provides less than 3% of our energy needs. Why? What is the motivation to put such shackles on the US economic engine? The excuse is that energy use drives up CO2 emissions and accelerates global warming - the excuse necessary to “harmonize” the  US into the socialist, Sustainable global noose.

Many current state and local policies now are moving to increase taxes at the gas  pump to keep energy costs high. As the prices rise the “planners”  will insist that the only solution is to enforce the building of expensive public transportation.

But, according to some anti-energy advocates, the fear of cheap energy goes beyond environmental protection - energy availability helps build wealth for  individuals and removes them from the rolls of the dependent—the  opposite goal of sustainable policy.

**“Giving society cheap, abundant energy is the worst thing that could ever happen to the planet.”** ***Prof. Paul Ehrlich (Professor of Population Studies, Stanford University).***

**“Complex technology of any sort is an assault on human dignity. It would be  little short of disastrous for us to discover a source of clean, cheap,  abundant energy, because of what we might do with it.”** ***Amory Lovins (Rocky Mountain Institute).***  

**“The prospect of cheap fusion energy is the worst thing that could happen to the planet.”** ***Jeremy Rifkin (Greenhouse Crisis Foundation).***

Alternative theory to explain global warming. No debunk so far,"Humans consume 10 million gigatons of water each year. 70% of that is used to water  plants in agriculture (1). The water on the fields has 3 ways to go:
 - sinking deep into lower levels of the soil 
 - evaporate 
 - being absorbed by the plants (what also eventually leads to evaporation, because plants evaporate water over the leaves)

Actually farmers try to increase field water efficiency (fraction of water used by plants to total water used) but let’s say only 10% evaporate. That means 700 000 gigatons of water evaporate each year. Most of it by Irrigation. Rivers are redirected and spread over huge agricultural areas. On that area the sun developes enough energy to evaporate the water while it would just run into  the ocean without human influence. So we are basically evaporating rivers all over the world. And that is much more efficient than digging for coal and burn it.

But what about rain? Water doesn’t stay in the atmosphere!

Yes, and that’s why many reliable sources claim human couldn’t influence water content in the atmosphere. Because it comes down again, it can’t increase, can it? Yes of course it can. The numbers of airplanes in the air is increasing even though they don’t stuck in the air. Around 16000 planes are in the air right now (2019) and this number is going to increase. Around 200000 takeoffs  every day, which means around 8000 take offs per hour. An average flight duration of 2 hours means, that when you take off, 16 000 other planes take off before you land. And if you increase the take offs per hour you will have more planes in the air, even if the average duration remains at 2 hours.
So the same thing with water. Water remains about 10 days in the atmosphere (2). As mentioned earlier, 700 000 gigatons are evaporated each year. That means 2000 gigatons per day. So within the 10 day lifetime of water 20 000 gigatons are  evaporated due to human influences. Compared to CO2 we emit 30 gigatons each year. according to the simple calculation above we increased the water content much more than we increased CO2. And that while H2O is a much more potent greenhouse gas than CO2. That would mean water vapor is the main cause of global warming!

Why can’t we measure the increase of water?

A gas needs around 1 year to reach each part of the atmosphere and even longer to be homogeneously mixed in the atmosphere. Since the lifetime of CO2 is so large, it actually is almost homogeneously mixed in the atmosphere. That means if you measure CO2 in only one spot, you know the content on alle other spots, because it’s the same.
H20 however has a short life time. The water content varies extremely in different location. When you see clouds, the water content is higher in the cloud than right next to it. You would need an infinite amount of measure spots to estimate the global water content in the atmosphere. Secondly the water content is around 2%. 2.43% or 2.44% is an increase by less than 1%. But for CO2 a difference between 0,03 and 0,04 is significant enough to be measured.

But we can’t add water to the atmosphere!

I never understood this argument. Ever hang out wet laundry? It dries in the sun. The water doesn’t disappear, it evaporates and is in the atmosphere. If the relative humidity (RH) was 100% the clothes wouldn’t dry. Sweating would be inefficient and you would have fog. At 100% RH you need to heat the air in order to take up more water. However when RH is below 100% it can take up more water. That’s the definition of RH. And as we observe in daily life, 100% RH is not common on surface altitude. That’s how sweating works, water is evaporating from the skin to cool the skin. And that’s possible without heating up the air, otherwise evolution wouldn’t have given us the ability to sweat.

Possible mistakes/errors

* most trivial would be a failed conversion between gigatons, cubic meter, kg etc.. because we are talking about millions of gigatons it’s possible. I think I did it right but maybe double check.
* error in the basic concept: maybe I overlooked something. Most likely the point why humans can’t add water to atmosphere. Many sources claim we have to heat up the air to increase water content. But I don’t understand why. I think it would be true at 100%RH but below we can ofcourse evaporate water as we observe in daily life. In Chile millions of liter of water are pumped to the surface and evaporated by the sun because in the remaining salt Lithium can be found. I think I gave enough example why I think we actually can evaporate water. The claim we can’t sounds so stupid to me, I don’t know why everyone says that.
* some more complex phenomenon is involved. Maybe water evaporated from agriculture has a different life time. A few hours would be enough though. The amount of water evaporation is so much higher than the CO2... Also i don’t see why water vapor from humans would behave different than natural vapor. We are basically just wetting the earths surface. Then the sun does the rest in natural processes.

(2) https://www.atmos-chem-phys-discuss.net/acp-2019-121/",0,"Alternative theory to explain global warming. No debunk so far Humans consume 10 million gigatons of water each year. 70% of that is used to water  plants in agriculture (1). The water on the fields has 3 ways to go:
 - sinking deep into lower levels of the soil 
 - evaporate 
 - being absorbed by the plants (what also eventually leads to evaporation, because plants evaporate water over the leaves)

Actually farmers try to increase field water efficiency (fraction of water used by plants to total water used) but let’s say only 10% evaporate. That means 700 000 gigatons of water evaporate each year. Most of it by Irrigation. Rivers are redirected and spread over huge agricultural areas. On that area the sun developes enough energy to evaporate the water while it would just run into  the ocean without human influence. So we are basically evaporating rivers all over the world. And that is much more efficient than digging for coal and burn it.

**Imagine that there is a new scientific theory that warns of an impending crisis, and points to a way out.**

This theory quickly draws support from leading scientists, politicians and celebrities around the world. Research is funded by distinguished philanthropies, and carried out at prestigious universities. The crisis is reported frequently in the media. The science is taught in college and high school classrooms.

I don’t mean global warming. I’m talking about another theory, which rose to prominence a century ago.

Its supporters included Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, and Winston Churchill. It was approved by Supreme Court justices Oliver Wendell Holmes and Louis Brandeis, who ruled in its favor. The famous names who supported it included Alexander Graham Bell, inventor of the telephone; activist Margaret Sanger; botanist Luther Burbank; Leland Stanford, founder of Stanford University; the novelist H. G. Wells; the playwright George Bernard Shaw; and hundreds of others. Nobel Prize winners gave support. Research was backed by the Carnegie and Rockefeller Foundations. The Cold Springs Harbor Institute was built to carry out this research, but important work was also done at Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Stanford and Johns Hopkins. Legislation to address the crisis was passed in states from New York to California.

These efforts had the support of the National Academy of Sciences, the American Medical Association, and the National Research Council. It was said that if Jesus were alive, he would have supported this effort.

All in all, the research, legislation and molding of public opinion surrounding the theory went on for almost half a century. Those who opposed the theory were shouted down and called reactionary, blind to reality, or just plain ignorant. But in hindsight, what is surprising is that so few people objected.

Today, we know that this famous theory that gained so much support was actually pseudoscience. The crisis it claimed was nonexistent. And the actions taken in the name of theory were morally and criminally wrong. Ultimately, they led to the deaths of millions of people.

**The theory was eugenics, and its history is so dreadful — and, to those who were caught up in it, so embarrassing — that it is now rarely discussed. But it is a story that should be well know to every citizen, so that its horrors are not repeated.**

The theory of eugenics postulated a crisis of the gene pool leading to the deterioration of the human race. The best human beings were not breeding as rapidly as the inferior ones — the foreigners, immigrants, Jews, degenerates, the unfit, and the “feeble minded.” Francis Galton, a respected British scientist, first speculated about this area, but his ideas were taken far beyond anything he intended. They were adopted by science-minded Americans, as well as those who had no interest in science but who were worried about the immigration of inferior races early in the twentieth century — “dangerous human pests” who represented “the rising tide of imbeciles” and who were polluting the best of the human race.

The eugenicists and the immigrationists joined forces to put a stop to this. The plan was to identify individuals who were feeble-minded — Jews were agreed to be largely feeble-minded, but so were many foreigners, as well as blacks — and stop them from breeding by isolation in institutions or by sterilization.

As Margaret Sanger said, “Fostering the good-for-nothing at the expense of the good is an extreme cruelty … there is not greater curse to posterity than that of bequeathing them an increasing population of imbeciles.” She spoke of the burden of caring for “this dead weight of human waste.”

Such views were widely shared. H.G. Wells spoke against “ill-trained swarms of inferior citizens.” Theodore Roosevelt said that “Society has no business to permit degenerates to reproduce their kind.” Luther Burbank” “Stop permitting criminals and weaklings to reproduce.” George Bernard Shaw said that only eugenics could save mankind.

There was overt racism in this movement, exemplified by texts such as “The Rising Tide of Color Against White World Supremacy” by American author Lothrop Stoddard. But, at the time, racism was considered an unremarkable aspect of the effort to attain a marvelous goal — the improvement of humankind in the future. It was this avant-garde notion that attracted the most liberal and progressive minds of a generation. California was one of twenty-nine American states to pass laws allowing sterilization, but it proved the most-forward-looking and enthusiastic — more sterilizations were carried out in California than anywhere else in America.

Eugenics research was funded by the Carnegie Foundation, and later by the Rockefeller Foundation. The latter was so enthusiastic that even after the center of the eugenics effort moved to Germany, and involved the gassing of individuals from mental institutions, the Rockefeller Foundation continued to finance German researchers at a very high level. (The foundation was quiet about it, but they were still funding research in 1939, only months before the onset of World War II.)

Since the 1920s, American eugenicists had been jealous because the Germans had taken leadership of the movement away from them. The Germans were admirably progressive. They set up ordinary-looking houses where “mental defectives” were brought and interviewed one at a time, before being led into a back room, which was, in fact, a gas chamber. There, they were gassed with carbon monoxide, and their bodies disposed of in a crematorium located on the property.

Eventually, this program was expanded into a vast network of concentration camps located near railroad lines, enabling the efficient transport and of killing of 'undesirables'.

After World War II, nobody was a eugenicist, and nobody had ever been a eugenicist. Biographers of the celebrated and the powerful did not dwell on the attractions of this philosophy to their subjects, and sometimes did not mention it at all. Eugenics ceased to be a subject for college classrooms, although some argue that its ideas continue to have currency in disguised form.

But in retrospect, three points stand out. First, despite the construction of Cold Springs Harbor Laboratory, despite the efforts of universities and the pleadings of lawyers, there was no scientific basis for eugenics. In fact, nobody at that time knew what a gene really was. The movement was able to proceed because it employed vague terms never rigorously defined. “Feeble-mindedness” could mean anything from poverty to illiteracy to epilepsy. Similarly, there was no clear definition of “degenerate” or “unfit.”

Second, the eugenics movement was really a social program masquerading as a scientific one. What drove it was concern about immigration and racism and undesirable people moving into one’s neighborhood or country. Once again, vague terminology helped conceal what was really going on.

Third, and most distressing, the scientific establishment in both the United States and Germany did not mount any sustained protest. Quite the contrary. In Germany scientists quickly fell into line with the program. Modern German researchers have gone back to review Nazi documents from the 1930s. They expected to find directives telling scientists what research should be done. But none were necessary. In the words of Ute Deichman, “Scientists, including those who were not members of the \[Nazi\] party, helped to get funding for their work through their modified behavior and direct cooperation with the state.” Deichman speaks of the “active role of scientists themselves in regard to Nazi race policy … where \[research\] was aimed at confirming the racial doctrine … no external pressure can be documented.” German scientists adjusted their research interests to the new policies. And those few who did not adjust disappeared.

A second example of politicized science is quite different in character, but it exemplifies the hazard of government ideology controlling the work of science, and of uncritical media promoting false concepts. Trofim Denisovich Lysenko was a self-promoting peasant who, it was said, “solved the problem of fertilizing the fields without fertilizers and minerals.” In 1928 he claimed to have invented a procedure called vernalization, by which seeds were moistened and chilled to enhance the later growth of crops.

Lysenko’s methods never faced a rigorous test, but his claim that his treated seeds passed on their characteristics to the next generation represented a revival of Lamarckian ideas at a time when the rest of the world was embracing Mendelian genetics. Josef Stalin was drawn to Lamarckian ideas, which implied a future unbounded by hereditary constraints; he also wanted improved agricultural production. Lysenko promised both, and became the darling of a Soviet media that was on the lookout for stories about clever peasants who had developed revolutionary procedures.

Lysenko was portrayed as a genius, and he milked his celebrity for all it was worth. He was especially skillful at denouncing this opponents. He used questionnaires from farmers to prove that vernalization increased crop yields, and thus avoided any direct tests. Carried on a wave of state-sponsored enthusiasm, his rise was rapid. By 1937, he was a member of the Supreme Soviet.

By then, Lysenko and his theories dominated Russian biology. The result was famines that killed millions, and purges that sent hundreds of dissenting Soviet scientists to the gulags or the firing squads. Lysenko was aggressive in attacking genetics, which was finally banned as “bourgeois pseudoscience” in 1948. There was never any basis for Lysenko’s ideas, yet he controlled Soviet research for thirty years. Lysenkoism ended in the 1960s, but Russian biology still has not entirely recovered from that era.

Now we are engaged in a great new theory that once again has drawn the support of politicians, scientists, and celebrities around the world.

* Once again, the theory is promoted by major foundations.
* Once again, the research is carried out at prestigious universities.
* Once again, legislation is passed and social programs are urged in its name.
* Once again, critics are few and harshly dealt with.
* Once again, the measures being urged have little basis in fact or science.
* Once again, groups with other agendas are hiding behind a movement that appears high-minded.
* Once again, claims of moral superiority are used to justify extreme actions.
* Once again, the fact that some people are hurt is shrugged off because an abstract cause is said to be greater than any human consequences.
* Once again, vague terms like sustainability and generational justice — terms that have no agreed definition — are employed in the service of a new crisis.

I am not arguing that global warming is the same as eugenics. But the similarities are not superficial. And I do claim that open and frank discussion of the data, and of the issues, is being suppressed. Leading scientific journals have taken strong editorial positions of the side of global warming, which, I argue, they have no business doing. Under the circumstances, any scientist who has doubts understands clearly that they will be wise to mute their expression.

One proof of this suppression is the fact that so many of the outspoken critics of global warming are retired professors. These individuals are not longer seeking grants, and no longer have to face colleagues whose grant applications and career advancement may be jeopardized by their criticisms.

In science, the old men are usually wrong. But in politics, the old men are wise, counsel caution, and in the end are often right.

The past history of human belief is a cautionary tale. We have killed thousands of our fellow human beings because we believed they had signed a contract with the devil, and had become witches. We still kill more than a thousand people each year for witchcraft. In my view, there is only one hope for humankind to emerge from what Carl Sagan called “the demon-haunted world” of our past. That hope is science.

But as Alston Chase put it, “when the search for truth is confused with political advocacy, the pursuit of knowledge is reduced to the quest for power.”

That is the danger we now face. And this is why the intermixing of science and politics is a bad combination, with a bad history. We must remember the history, and be certain that what we present to the world as knowledge is disinterested and honest.

"I'm a climate alarmist wishing to step outside the echo chamber, please show me arguments and studies I can read.","Hello everyone

I've been doing activism lately, among other things against climate change. It has occurred to me that while I am somewhat familiar with the arguments, studies and data that suggest human made climate change is real, I do not know much about arguments and data that suggest the opposite.

I want to see both sides here so I can draw my own conclusions having seen all the arguments, I don't want to form my opinion on the topic with only information from my echo chamber. Please send me arguments against climate change, as well as scientific studies. I have lots of free time in the next 24 hours, so I can hopefully read through several studies.

Here's my current opinion on the topic so we'll have a starting point for the debate:

""Greenhouse gases like CO2, methane and others are causing the greenhouse gas effect which increases the average temperature on Earth's surface. This has allowed life on Earth to develop in the first place. Due to heavy use of fossil fuels, animal agriculture and others, humanity is rapidly increasing the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, pushing the warming effect beyond the natural balance. This is, and will be causing, according to scientific predictions, biodiversity loss, an increase of global mean temperature, an increase of extreme weather events, loss of arable land to desertification loss of living space due to flooding, and several hundreds of millions of refugees.""

I look forward to an enlightening conversation and to reading some studies. Thanks in advance for sending me arguments and sources.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit 1: Thanks a lot for all the sources and articles sent already, it will take me some time to read through them, I might not be able to respond to each of you personally, especially if the rate of informative answers with sources continues at this rate. The IPCC AR5 and SR15 reports will keep me busy for quite some time, I imagine.

I am from r/collapse. It is rank with confirmation bias. I came here for some good counter arguments and hopefully good news.,"I am from r/collapse. I joined some 2 months back when i found it while browsing some other news article regarding doomsday.

We have absolutely no hopeful news there at all. This can't be. There are people doing a lot of stuff and there has to be some good news. This smelled like confirmation bias. So I came here looking for counter arguments.

Here is what i know:

1. Permafrost has a lot of methane frozen away. (Is this true? How did it get frozen there in the first place?)

2. Methane is a very potent green house gas. Depending upon how you count it is 70-83 times more potent than CO2.

3. We have taken carbon out of the ground and released it into the atmosphere in last 150 years. We increased the co2 levels to 412ppm from~250ppm. This has already increased the average temp by 0.8C from pre industrial levels.


4. Increasing temperature melts white ice that reflects suns light. This creating a feedback loop that further increases the temp.

5. One day we will melt permafrost and release methane. This will dramatically increase temperature. This will melt more permafrost and release more methane and thus create another feedback loop.

6. All this temp increase will be as bad as permian extinction when some volcano caused this permafrost (or was it clathrate) to release methane and kill 90% of all life. This is extremely bad scenario when permafrost releases 5% of its methane in to the air when one fine day melting sets off one of the clathrate guns.

Meanwhile increasing temps would cause extreme weathers, disrupt food security, increase spread of diseases which were checked by cool climate etc. etc. humans are bad neighbors under stressful conditions and we have a collapse.",0,"I am from r/collapse.

1. Permafrost has a lot of methane frozen away. (Is this true? How did it get frozen there in the first place?)

2. Methane is a very potent green house gas. Depending upon how you count it is 70-83 times more potent than CO2.

3. We have taken carbon out of the ground and released it into the atmosphere in last 150 years. We increased the co2 levels to 412ppm from~250ppm. This has already increased the average temp by 0.8C from pre industrial levels.


4. Increasing temperature melts white ice that reflects suns light. This creating a feedback loop that further increases the temp.

5. One day we will melt permafrost and release methane. This will dramatically increase temperature. This will melt more permafrost and release more methane and thus create another feedback loop.

6. All this temp increase will be as bad as permian extinction when some volcano caused this permafrost (or was it clathrate) to release methane and kill 90% of all life. This is extremely bad scenario when permafrost releases 5% of its methane in to the air when one fine day melting sets off one of the clathrate guns.

Meanwhile increasing temps would cause extreme weathers, disrupt food security, increase spread of diseases which were checked by cool climate etc. etc. humans are bad neighbors under stressful conditions and we have a collapse."

The ice caps melting at an alarming rate each year, negatively affecting thousands of animals.

Ticks will migrate into and infest areas where you used to enjoy hiking, due to them coming out earlier each year.

Trees killed in an unprecedented flood in Italy. Mass cattle die-off in Australia's post-drought floods.

Each year, human beings release an increasing amount of carbon dioxide (C02) into the atmosphere; at present, around 40 billion tons per annum.

A small rodent named  the Bramble Cay melomys that lived only on a single island off Australia is likely the world's first mammal to become a casualty of climate change. Since 1998, the part of the island that sits above high tide has shrunk from 9.8 acres to 6.2 acres. That means the island's vegetation has been shrinking, and the rodents have lost about 97 percent of their habitat.

The First Global Revolution (1991),"My cause for skepticism lies in the motives of those who refer to climate change to demand more power and money from the people. If you trace back the history of UN groups and activities on climate change, you'll quickly arrive at the think tank ""Club of Rome"" which was founded among others by David Rockefeller (oil and banking billionaire).

This think tank published an initial critique on economic growth (""The Limits to Growth"") in 1972, followed by - more interestingly - a blueprint to how the world should be run in the 21st century: ""The First Global Revolution"". This latter book was published in 1991, closely preceding the UN conference in Rio in 1992 that kicked off environmental efforts (from the UN perspective that's Agenda 21 followed by Agenda 2030).

They literally said in the book, and this does appear to be a legitimate quote:

&gt;Because of the sudden absence of traditional enemies, ""new enemies must be identified.""[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_First_Global_Revolution#cite_note-King70-2)  ""**In searching for a new enemy to unite us, we came up with the idea  that pollution, the threat of global warming, water shortages, famine  and the like would fit the bill**....All these dangers are caused by human  intervention, and it is only through changed attitudes and behavior  that they can be overcome. The real enemy then, is humanity itself.""[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_First_Global_Revolution#cite_note-King115-3)

So this would be quite consistent with the idea that environmental problems are being hijacked in an effort to gain power and money for unelected elites, in essence taking us back to NWO conspiracies. Looking into the background of many UN representatives, they are in many cases also from big oil and finance, and some have been involved in bad corruption scandals, so it's not an immediately credible claim to make that they are in it purely for the good of all mankind.

There's also this ongoing conflict between UN / Western goals of reducing CO2 emissions and supporting mass immigration and overpopulation, most of which typically trace back to rich and powerful supporters as well ( [http://www.centuryinitiative.ca/about/](http://www.centuryinitiative.ca/about/) , [https://www.weforum.org/reports/business-case-migration](https://www.weforum.org/reports/business-case-migration) , [https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-18519395](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-18519395) ).

There's the argument that nobody cares for the UN anyway and they have no say in anything, but Western governments and supranational organizations largely seem to agree immediately on most of these things. I'm not  sure how these dominant globalist organizations relate to socialist / green parties though.

Recommend regular reading of The Drudgereport, Breitbart, and The Watchers to keep apprized of some of the more interesting, useful and detailed news, which is unlikely to be seen on the ""Nightly Snoozes"".

For the more extreme afficianados, be careful with Infowars. It's loaded with a lot of anti-vaxxers and other info processing problems.

But recall, the greatest growth. new events occurring, does not any longer come from the standard news networks and what they report. Rather, given the massive decline of the sciences from junk science reports, which esp is damaging medical pharmacologies, just do a lot of careful checking to ascertain what's ""Likely"" going on.

As far as today's news in the Middle East and the climate of events there, Jpost.com of Jerusalem for weather and other such; and the very interesting Dailystar.com.lb from Beirut, which gives a more expansive and interesting viewpoint about Middle East events and climate events, as well.

Lots of times the Jpost and the Daily Star are the ONLY sources giving details about what's going on with the weather there, confirming the problems, as well. Such as the loss of about 50% of Iran's Agro land and spring plantings, which will have a devastatin effect upon their food production. Starvation widely is possible.

And 40% of bridges and transport infrastructure damaged by storms, well past easy repairs, within the last few weeks.

So read widely, and as a former older, yet highly experienced woman once told me so presciently &amp; wisely:

Read widely and compare, compare, compare to find out what's likely going on.

Better wisdom than that have yet to find regarding climate events and related weather news, outside of the Watchers.",0,"More Very Violent, Very Unusual European Storms https://watchers.news/2019/06/16/violent-hailstorms-batter-france-catastrophic-agricultural-damage-reported/

Sun Is at Total Sunspot Minimum. NO Sunspots for a Month!!!,"http://www.sidc.be/DATA/uset/png/2019/06/UPH20190617123721.png

Google ""Silso"" . haven't seen this at all since the last sunspot minimum about 2008-9. Because they are calling sunspot #'s where they did not exist in traditional, historical images, we can be pretty sure this is just as empty as the one was in later cycle#23.

and it will likely as long term, too. &amp; if it continues into this coming winter, we will see weather very likely, on average as cold as has been seen in generations, esp. in Eurozone, where their very northerly location, if not for the Gulf Stream, would mean trouble.

So, keep an eye out for this one. The earliest, best solid evidence of coming global cooling and thus the collapse of the Warmers' claims will be Likely Seen here:

The skeptic position,"My sense is that most skeptics agree that the Earth has been warming since the 1800s. The questions are

- how much of that global warming is anthropogenic (this can diverge from the consensus that the majority is human caused)

- how much of the anthropogenic warming is related to co2 emissions (deforestation, albedo change, urban heat can have their own share)

- how much global temperature affects local climate and weather (we can potentially make all the changes to remove any human effect on global temperature, and still have huge changes in climate)

- what extent are the negative effects of local climate and weather changes (alarmism says we're all going to become climate refugees and then die. Maybe we just crank up the ac and grow coffee in Canada)

- what positive effects we might see (higher co2 could lead to food abundance)

- what the cost to transition to a zero carbon economy is (many act like this has no cost to quality of life, but indications are that limiting carbon economies would lead to suffering)

I'd even go further to say that to be a ""climate change denier"", one would need to deny that any changes in local climates are occurring over decades. To deny *the possibility* that the artic is warming and the US surface is cooling would be examples of climate change denial and don't really have much merit in a scientific discussion.",0,"The skeptic position My sense is that most skeptics agree that the Earth has been warming since the 1800s.
