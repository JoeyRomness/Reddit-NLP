"Debunking ""climate skeptics,"" part 1. There is no greenhouse gas effect.","Hi guys! I'm thinking about making a series of posts debunking various ""climate skeptic"" arguments. First, I'll say that ""climate skeptic"" is a poorly defined term, but that seems to be the self-identification a lot of these people use. These ""climate skeptics"" run the gamut from fairly reasonable people like Judith Curry to nutjobs like Anthony Heller. Maybe I'll get to him later.

So today's post is about people who don't even think there is a greenhouse effect. I've argued with several people like this in a different climate subreddit. There's even a paper by Nikolov and Zeller (2017) about it (see sources below).

There's a fun little story about these guys. So there was a paper published by Volokin and ReLlez (2014), well, it turns out that's just Nikolov and Zeller spelling their names backwards. So I guess now it's Nikolov and Zeller (2014). Anthony Watts wrote about this. In case you're not aware, Anthony Watts runs [wattsupwiththat.com](https://wattsupwiththat.com), a ""climate skeptic"" blog, so you might expect they would have a sympathetic view towards the paper. Here's what Watts had to say about it ([https://wattsupwiththat.com/2016/09/14/climate-skeptics-behaving-badly/](https://wattsupwiththat.com/2016/09/14/climate-skeptics-behaving-badly/)):

""Submitting a paper with your names reversed? I’m sorry… **This. is. just. stupid.** And I agree with Gavin, the paper itself is nonsense. Their work has been the same sort of “pressure rules the temperature of planetary atmospheres” nonsense that the irascible Doug Cotton pushes…under multiple fake names to try to get attention, here and elsewhere. Now they seem to have followed his lead.

I’ve had experience with these two people, Nikolov and Zeller before….and it has not been a good experience. There’s some behind the scenes ugliness they presented in email that I don’t plan to talk about. That’s why I don’t carry their views anymore and never will again, that’s doubly true now after this sad move with the fake names.""

Anyway, enough of the silly drama, let's look at what the papers say. So the standard view of the greenhouse effect is (Schmidt 2010):

""The global mean greenhouse effect can be defined as the difference between the planetary blackbody emitting temperature (in balance with the absorbed solar irradiance) and the global mean surface temperature. The actual mean surface temperature is larger (by around 33°C, assuming a constant planetary albedo) due to the absorption and emission of long‐wave (LW) radiation in the atmosphere by a number of different “greenhouse” substances.""

In other words, without an atmosphere, earth's temperature would be \~33 degrees Celsius cooler. So Nikolov and Zeller (2014) calculate the difference, using unconventional methods, as \~90 degrees Celsius:

""Physical evidence is presented that Earth’s ATE should be assessed against the temperature of an equivalent airless body such as the Moon rather than a hypothetical atmosphere devoid of greenhouse gases. Employing the new temperature formula we show that Earth’s *total* ATE is \~90 K, not 33 K, and that ATE = GE + TE, where GE is the thermal effect of greenhouse gases, while TE &gt; 15 K is a thermodynamic enhancement independent of the atmospheric infrared back radiation. It is concluded that the contribution of greenhouse gases to Earth’s ATE defined as GE = ATE – TE might be greater than 33 K, but will remain uncertain until the strength of the hereto identified TE is fully quantified by future research.""

So, unusual, but if true this would seem to indicate that traditional estimates of the total greenhouse effect are actually underestimates, with some (at that point) nebulous additional contribution raising the global temperature.

Nikolov and Zeller (2017) runs this even farther off the rails:

""A key entailment from the model is that the atmospheric ‘greenhouse effect’ currently viewed as a radiative phenomenon is in fact an adiabatic (pressure-induced) thermal enhancement analogous to compression heating and independent of atmospheric composition.""

According to them, planetary temperatures are only dependent on top-of-the-atmosphere solar irradiance and total surface atmospheric pressure. How'd they come to that conclusion? It's an interesting case, the paper may look convincing on the surface. Roughly, they came up with a bunch of regression models using physical parameters for various solar system bodies, found one that seemed to show that the surface temperature could be calculated using solar irradiance and atmospheric pressure, then concluded that only those two variables contribute to planetary temperature.

This blog post ([http://rabett.blogspot.com/2017/08/making-elephant-dance-as-performed-by.html](http://rabett.blogspot.com/2017/08/making-elephant-dance-as-performed-by.html)) breaks it down some more:

""So briefly, what goes on is to fit the five average surface temperatures of five plants or moons (Venus, Earth, the Moon, Mars, Titan and Triton.  Wait you say, that's six, not five, but they leave Titan out of the mix because  (Eli told you this would be yummy) to an arbitrary functional form

y = *a* exp(*b*x) + *c* exp(*d*x)

Wait you say again, ok, that is four parameters and the functional form plucked out of thin air, but what is *x* and *y.*  That's kind of interesting and more than a bit light fingered but you have to watch the moving cup.  The independent variable is a ratio of pressures *(Ps/Pr)*.  *Ps* is the pressure at the surface, *Pr*, well that's interesting, *Pr* starts out as the ""*minimum air pressure required for the existence of a liquid solvent at the surface, hereto called a reference pressure (Pr)*"" but about a page further on it morphs into

&gt;For a reference pressure, we used the gas-liquid-solid triple point of water, i.e., *Pr*=611.73Pa \[38\] defining a baric threshold, below which water can only exists in a solid/vapor phase and not in a liquid form. The results of our analysis are not sensitive to the particular choice of a reference pressure value; hence, the selection of *Pr* is a matter of convention.

The alert out there have noticed that the minimum air pressure required for the existence of a liquid solvent at the surface kind of depends on the temperature of the surface, and would vary widely from planet to planet. Of course worry bunnies like Eli might ask:  What liquid?  Water exists as water on the surface of the Earth, if there was any as steam at Venus and as ice at all the others if it exists there at all.  For Venus maybe CO2, but at the surface of Venus CO2 is a supercritical fluid and you can't tell the difference between liquid and gas.  At Titan, there are oceans, but oceans of methane, so any useful *Pr* is going to be wildly different for all of these bodies and, in the case of the Mars, and Triton some pretty fancy liquids are going to be needed.

Selection of water as the solvent of choice is then both arbitrary and unphysical.  But why do Nikolov and Zeller insist on using it? Turns out their elephantine trunk waving depends on using dimensionless variables, but restricting *Pr* to an inappropriate value independent of the planet is equivalent to stripping the units off of the surface pressure *Ps*.""

&amp;#x200B;

So, the paper is a good example of how, with enough statistics and cherry-picking, and enough variables, you can come to almost any conclusion you want. It is to be expected that you would find a correlation between atmospheric pressure and planetary temperature; planets with a denser atmosphere generally have more greenhouse gases. Of course, the paper fails to explain the TOA absorption spectrum or other evidence for the greenhouse effect ([http://geosci.uchicago.edu/\~rtp1/papers/PhysTodayRT2011.pdf](http://geosci.uchicago.edu/~rtp1/papers/PhysTodayRT2011.pdf)). Am I being too dismissive? Well, in the more rational parts of ""climate skeptic"" world, the paper was also dismissed. I usually take anything published at wattsupwiththat with a big grain of salt, but here ([https://wattsupwiththat.com/2012/01/13/a-matter-of-some-gravity/?fbclid=IwAR1Lkiqzw8bCx06u5ABMQMfevy0bweKzZfdBatFOIj0aWTAmi\_HrcKEYJDQ](https://wattsupwiththat.com/2012/01/13/a-matter-of-some-gravity/?fbclid=IwAR1Lkiqzw8bCx06u5ABMQMfevy0bweKzZfdBatFOIj0aWTAmi_HrcKEYJDQ)) Eschenbach does a decent job explaining why the hypothesis of Nikolov and Zeller violates the law of conservation of energy:

""I hold that with a transparent GHG-free atmosphere, neither the hypothetical “N&amp;Z effect” nor the “Jelbring effect” can possibly raise the planetary temperature above the theoretical S-B temperature. But I also make a much more general claim. I hold it can be proven that there is **no possible mechanism involving gravity and the atmosphere** that can raise the temperature of a planet with a transparent GHG-free atmosphere above the theoretical S-B temperature.

The proof is by contradiction. This is a proof where you assume that the theorem is right, and then show that if it is right it leads to an impossible situation, so it cannot possibly be right.

So let us assume that we have the airless perfectly evenly heated blackbody planet that I spoke of above, evenly surrounded by a sphere of mini-suns. The temperature of this theoretical planet is, of course, the theoretical S-B temperature.

Now suppose we add an atmosphere to the planet, a transparent GHG-free atmosphere. If the theories of N&amp;K and Jelbring are correct, the temperature of the planet will rise.

But when the temperature of a perfect blackbody planet rises … the surface radiation of that planet must rise as well.

And because the atmosphere is transparent, this means that **the planet is radiating to space more energy than it receives.** This is an obvious violation of conservation of energy, so any theories proposing such a warming must be incorrect.

Q.E.D.""

And some more criticism of Nikolov and Zeller from blogs (no one has bothered to publish a rebuttal in the literature):

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR? Nikolov and Zeller are wrong, models of planetary surface temperatures without the greenhouse gas effect violate the law of conservation of energy.

A company which uses multiple ways of reducing carbon emissions and pays their employees in a different way. It would provide the employees a place of living and provide necessities like water, the company would be self-sufficient where there are jobs broken up into different areas such as resource gathering departments(which would focus on gathering water, planting and harvesting food, and such), science and engineering departments(creating and building new or more efficient ways to improve carbon emission reduction and such), and other areas like construction crew, safety crew, etc. A company which grows by hiring people who are willing to do work for a place to live, eat, grow, and help make a difference in this world. Obviously the pay would not be limited to only residency and basic necessities. Many of the jobs on its company would include, creating energy from people power such as riding a bike/treadmill generator or planting trees and such.

Couldn’t find a flaw in this conspiracy about an alternative cause of global warming,"Humans consume 10 million gigatons of water each year. 70% of that is used to water  plants in agriculture (1). The water on the fields has 3 ways to go:
 - sinking deep into lower levels of the soil 
 - evaporate 
 - being absorbed by the plants (what also eventually leads to evaporation, because plants evaporate water over the leaves)

Actually farmers try to increase field water efficiency (fraction of water used by plants to total water used) but let’s say only 10% evaporate. That means 700 000 gigatons of water evaporate each year. Most of it by Irrigation. Rivers are redirected and spread over huge agricultural areas. On that area the sun developes enough energy to evaporate the water while it would just run into  the ocean without human influence. So we are basically evaporating rivers all over the world. And that is much more efficient than digging for coal and burn it.

But what about rain? Water doesn’t stay in the atmosphere!

Yes, and that’s why many reliable sources claim human couldn’t influence water content in the atmosphere. Because it comes down again, it can’t increase, can it? Yes of course it can. The numbers of airplanes in the air is increasing even though they don’t stuck in the air. Around 16000 planes are in the air right now (2019) and this number is going to increase. Around 200000 takeoffs  every day, which means around 8000 take offs per hour. An average flight duration of 2 hours means, that when you take off, 16 000 other planes take off before you land. And if you increase the take offs per hour you will have more planes in the air, even if the average duration remains at 2 hours.
So the same thing with water. Water remains about 10 days in the atmosphere (2). As mentioned earlier, 700 000 gigatons are evaporated each year. That means 2000 gigatons per day. So within the 10 day lifetime of water 20 000 gigatons are  evaporated due to human influences. Compared to CO2 we emit 30 gigatons each year. according to the simple calculation above we increased the water content much more than we increased CO2. And that while H2O is a much more potent greenhouse gas than CO2. That would mean water vapor is the main cause of global warming!

Why can’t we measure the increase of water?

A gas needs around 1 year to reach each part of the atmosphere and even longer to be homogeneously mixed in the atmosphere. Since the lifetime of CO2 is so large, it actually is almost homogeneously mixed in the atmosphere. That means if you measure CO2 in only one spot, you know the content on alle other spots, because it’s the same.
H20 however has a short life time. The water content varies extremely in different location. When you see clouds, the water content is higher in the cloud than right next to it. You would need an infinite amount of measure spots to estimate the global water content in the atmosphere. Secondly the water content is around 2%. 2.43% or 2.44% is an increase by less than 1%. But for CO2 a difference between 0,03 and 0,04 is significant enough to be measured.

But we can’t add water to the atmosphere!

I never understood this argument. Ever hang out wet laundry? It dries in the sun. The water doesn’t disappear, it evaporates and is in the atmosphere. If the relative humidity (RH) was 100% the clothes wouldn’t dry. Sweating would be inefficient and you would have fog. At 100% RH you need to heat the air in order to take up more water. However when RH is below 100% it can take up more water. That’s the definition of RH. And as we observe in daily life, 100% RH is not common on surface altitude. That’s how sweating works, water is evaporating from the skin to cool the skin. And that’s possible without heating up the air, otherwise evolution wouldn’t have given us the ability to sweat.

Possible mistakes/errors

* most trivial would be a failed conversion between gigatons, cubic meter, kg etc.. because we are talking about millions of gigatons it’s possible. I think I did it right but maybe double check.
* error in the basic concept: maybe I overlooked something. Most likely the point why humans can’t add water to atmosphere. Many sources claim we have to heat up the air to increase water content. But I don’t understand why. I think it would be true at 100%RH but below we can ofcourse evaporate water as we observe in daily life. In Chile millions of liter of water are pumped to the surface and evaporated by the sun because in the remaining salt Lithium can be found. I think I gave enough example why I think we actually can evaporate water. The claim we can’t sounds so stupid to me, I don’t know why everyone says that.
* some more complex phenomenon is involved. Maybe water evaporated from agriculture has a different life time. A few hours would be enough though. The amount of water evaporation is so much higher than the CO2... Also i don’t see why water vapor from humans would behave different than natural vapor. We are basically just wetting the earths surface. Then the sun does the rest in natural processes.

I think it’s more likely I did a mistake and that most of other scientists are right. However I didn’t find a flaw here. Most people I explained this to blamed me as a sceptic but didn’t have any scientific argument. I’m open to discussion but I hope you are open too and can consider my thoughts scientifically and neutrally even though it’s against the consensus.
Thank you.

Show Your Strips: Warming Stripes From 1901-2018 - Asia is clearly in trouble.,"Found a great site today called [Show Your Stripes](https://showyourstripes.info/) which visualized the average yearly temperatures, by country, from 1901 to 2018.

How Can I Fight Climate Change,"Hi All,

I am young (early 30s) and have made enough money to never work again. I would like to dedicate the rest of my life to fighting climate change and thought I’d ask you where my time would be best spent. 

My skill set is business related, rather than advocacy / politics or engineering / science so I am thinking I would be most effective setting up a company with the explicit purpose of fighting climate change and pushing all excess profits back into research. Do you agree with this? If so, what business would have the most impact that is not already well served?

I’ll add that I live in the Pacific Northwest between Canada and the US.

"If the greenhouse effect is causing global warming, wouldn't building a massive multi-square kilometer mirror/a network of millions of mirrors solve all problems?","Seeing some news about solar farms actually raising local weather temperatures due to the fact the black surfaces absorb so much heat has gotten me thinking

&amp;#x200B;

If a problem is the melting ice caps leading to more ocean, the dark surface absorbing more sunlight, and other problems involving the trapping of sunlight, mirrors would reflect light directly back into space.

So if we just covered several square kilometers of ocean or unused land (deserts already reflect a lot of sunlight) with floating mirrors/polish aluminum sheets, wouldn't this solve global warming? just paving land with aluminum foil or millions of floating foil-covered objects covering square kilometers of the ocean?

Are we still heading towards a RCP 8.5 World?,"I have a decent feeling that we'll be hitting peak carbon emissions soon. The coal industry is slowly crumbling, renewables such as solar are outpacing coal and are becoming exponentially cheaper. Many countries (and even US states) are beginning to lower emissions. Even China is supposedly peaking emissions soon as it replaces it's coal production with renewables as it transfers to a service economy. 

And yet, I'm hearing it'll take ~20 years for most of the coal plants currently running to be decomissioned. France is reporting 110 F weather in a bitter heatwave. I'm hearing that even our exponential progress with reducing emissions, bit by bit, are not enough to keep us under a 3 or 4 C future.

Are we still heading towards a RCP 8.5 World? Or have we begun to veer more towards a less catastrophic 6.0 or 4.5 world? Has any real progress been made in the 11 months since the August report?",climatechange

What makes climate change now different from previous periods of climate change?,"I should start out by saying I’m in no way trying to deny human-caused climate change! I’m just curious as to whether there are differences between climate change now and previous periods of climate change. 

I recently listened to a podcast on ice ages, and it explained how the planet has been through a lot of periods of warming and cooling. It got me thinking, life on earth has survived these periods and it seems fairly natural, so what makes the current period of man-made climate change different? I think it’s easiest to just list my questions below. 

1.) There’s a lot of talk of more extreme weather events because of climate change. Was this the case during periods of climate change hundreds of millions of years ago as well? Or is it specific to climate change now? 

2.) If the planet has already been through periods of climate change, is there anything that makes this period unique? Is it faster? Are the gases in the atmosphere different? 

3.) Is the reason climate change now is so bad because it’s also coupled with other human-caused phenomena like industrial agriculture and deforestation?

A thought about climate change.,"If you spill petrol on snow it melts.. It does try it.

So what if the snow melting is not global warming but something else??..

I have an idea what else it could be..

&amp;#x200B;

Imagine the smoke from all the cars?.. When the smoke blows all over the world the rain comes down and mixes with the smoke creating rain with petrol in it??.. And when it hits the floor its like spilling petrol all over the snow?..

But way milder than petrol ..watered down petrol.. Some say acid rain??..NO not acid rain.

&amp;#x200B;

Just think if you light a fire and pour pure water over the smoke the water is not pure anymore its mixed with the smoke.

And what ever is in the smoke will be in the water in less amounts because of the water added..

&amp;#x200B;

The fact its got nothing to do with the earth heating up.. Just pure water as in rain soaking it up and putting it back on the land with snow on it..  And smoke blows all over the place ..

&amp;#x200B;

More people in Canada .. Smoke getting blew all over Canada with the rain coming down will hit the snow and melt it faster.. Like petrol in the snow but diluted petrol from the rain pouring down..

&amp;#x200B;

Green land more smoke created ..Blows over the antarctica snow fall captures the smoke with petrol in it..

They call it acid rain   BUT  they sayits because of the earth heating up when it has nothing to do with the heat ..

&amp;#x200B;

It was all to do with the smoke..   Get smoke pour PURE WATER over it and test the water ..

And we have smoke blowing everywhere .. All over the world .. 

those parts it rains or snows will fall all over the smoke and melt the ice caps ..

&amp;#x200B;

Is this a fact??.. No i don't know but it very well could be .. And much more of a fact than Co2 is heating the earth up..",climatechange

&amp;#x200B;

Not one of the top 10 emitter countries meet its current Paris agreement target. Even if all the countries meet its current goals, that put us to a 3C warming ( [https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/12/07/climate/world-emissions-paris-goals-not-on-track.html](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/12/07/climate/world-emissions-paris-goals-not-on-track.html) ), very much short of hitting 2C, and 1.5C is basically a pipe dream. 

&amp;#x200B;

In fact, 6 of the top 10 emitter countries, including us, are in the highly/critically insufficient categories, which basically are emitting towards 3C+/4C+. 

&amp;#x200B;

And these are the ""easy"" goals. The basic premise for the Paris agreement is that reaching the ""easy"" goals will bootstrap countries to be more ambitious. Since almost no one who matters reaches the easy goals, there is little hope (at least for me) that we are going to reach the more ambitious ones. Some may wish for some miracle carbon capture tech that saves the day. But wishing is not a strategy. There is no indication that such a tech (and the necessary scale up) is going to be available soon.

&amp;#x200B;

And i also ask myself .. why no countries step up enough. The answer is clear. Humans are basically selfish and myopic. You can blame the politicians. But look at what the voters and the public chose in Brazil, Australia and even here in the US. Even the French yellow jackets are against a carbon tax. Basically people care more about their immediate livelihood than saving the planet (i.e. don't tax me and ask me to walk to work)

&amp;#x200B;

I am sure many are going to try to move minds. Many are going to create a lot of noises. Personally i do not believe we are going to avoid 2C+, probably 3C or even more .. given all the issues about permafrost de-frosing well in advance of projection. The good news is that in a rich country like the US, as long as I do not live close to the coast (which I do not, and will not), survival is probably not a problem. There will be addition heating/cooling and maintenance costs but the US (and other first world countries) will probably be fine.  I am certainly sad about the Fiji and other less fortunate people who are going to be impacted. But like what is happening in India now, i do not believe there is anything I can do. And yes, if everyone thinks like that, we are doomed ... but that is the point. Most human thinks like that. Selfishness is in our nature. Look up the classical tragedy of the common problem. We doom ourselves.

Dangers of air pollution - another argument for climate crisis?,"I've been reading a lot of information and debates on the climate crisis lately, and furthermore been finding a lot of people simply stating that greenhouse gases aren't an issue, all the scientific evidence is faked and flawed, that this isn't due to humans, etc. I often don't know where to start with debating these. I think part of that reason is that we have a lot of arguments and information, but it may be the same thing being used over and over again. Don't get me wrong, this is crucial and undeniable information. But if someone isn't going to listen to it, I figure I should think of a new way to debate it. 

So I've been thinking about some new points to use, specifically about carbon and other GHG emissions. Here's the one I think may be pretty solid:

**Greenhouse gases and air pollution are extremely dangerous to all people living in an effected area.** 

I think about large cities in countries such as India and China. These places have so much air pollution (which is quite obviously due to the human activity) and it is very harmful to the people there.

&gt;Dangerous weather conditions such a acid rain and smog have created hazards for Indian citizens. Acid rain contains hydrogen ions, which can damage trees, crops, harm marine animals and destroy metals. Sometimes the damage that is done from acid rain can be devastating. Smog causes harmful health effects in humans and animals.  Studies have shown signs of black lung disease in dolphins of due to high concentrations of carbon particles in the air. The effects of smog can be irreversible, impacting someone's future health greatly.  
Unfortunately, aside from strange yet dangerous weather, frequent exposure to polluted air increases the risk of cardiovascular disease. This restricts many Indians from exercising, since that's when air consumption is used more rapidly.  Breathing air that is filled with small particles can increase the chance of getting hardening of the arteries, triggering cardiac arrhythmia or even having a heart attack. Statistics show that annual premature deaths caused by particulate air pollution have increased by six times since the year 2000.

(quote from the India Pollution Project)

On top of this, the Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute in India found that 2.2 million Indian children are affected by lung damage that they will carry the rest of their lives - and a UNICEF report listed that air pollution is responsible for 600,00 deaths of Indian children below the age of five every year.

This is something caused by human activity and over emissions, and it is extremely harmful. What happens as countries such as the United States continue to spew so many GHGs into the atmosphere? It will create more dangerous conditions. I know it may not get as severe as these huge cities, mostly due to the really high population densities in these specific examples, but it still goes to show how these things are harmful and detrimental to everyone.

I don't want this to be seen as me saying that other things aren't true arguments, I just feel like we should introduce new ones to people who are truly dead set on denying previous ones. Maybe this isn't even a new idea, I just haven't heard it before in the climate change debate setting. So that's my idea. Is this a good argument? Does anyone have any things to add or point out?

What are your ideas for explaining the science of climate change as easily as possible?,"I was hoping we could have a discussion about easy ways to spread the science! I've noticed that the main issue I have in any climate change discussion is that I don't have enough time to properly explain the science in any way that has real impact. I was hoping /r/climatechange could help me solve this problem. If you have suggestions for other points or other ways to get across those points, I'll add them gladly! Try to be as short and impactful as possible. Here's some topics, and ideas that don't seem very effective because they're too long:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Why gases cause the climate to change:

&amp;#x200B;

(I've been told that this idea misrepesents the information by /u/deck_hand, although I personally think the cause and affect relationship is decent) We know a warm object in a cold room becomes cool, and a cold object in a warm room becomes warm. The earth is sort of like the opposite of a cooler. It keeps us warm in the absolute zero temperatures of space. The power source of this heater is the combination of gases covering the surface that trap heat emitted by the sun. Putting more of these gases into the atmosphere is the converse of putting more ice in the cooler, the planet gets more hot rather quickly.

&amp;#x200B;

From /u/Wallawallawallawa 

2. The reason this is multiplicative:

&amp;#x200B;

When you put ice in a cooler, the cooler and objects inside don't become instantly cold. No, the ice slowly heats up the surrounding air and the objects inside. Then, because it's a cooler, the ice stays frozen for a long while. Even when the ice begins to melt, the temperature doesn't reach above freezing until all of the ice has melted. Now apply that concept to the planet on a global scale. The planet slowly heats up over the course of years due to released emissions, then it will stay like heated while the gases stay trapped in our atmosphere. Whereas the ice melts in a few hours, because of the size of the planet, most of these gases won't leave our atmosphere for 100 years.

&amp;#x200B;

3. The reason it's detrimental:

&amp;#x200B;

Key points could possibly be; sea level rise, increased weather anomalies/anomaly severity with decreased predictability, why the small change in temperature has enough impact to kill off hundreds of species.

&amp;#x200B;

From /u/Wallawallawallawa:  We are currently on track for warming of close to 4 degrees Celsius by 2100. Temperatures have changed in the past too. The last 200 thousand years or so, we can clearly distinguish 6 ice ages. The last ice age resulted in a build up of a huge glacier across Northern US and Northern Europe. New York was buried under 1 km of ice. The ice reached higher than the skyscrapers do today. The global temperature difference then with respect to today: 4 degrees Celsius 

&amp;#x200B;

From /u/Macralicious:  A warming climate produces more extreme weather events, and this has a detrimental impact on our ability to grow food. Right now for example, huge swathes of farmland in the US are waterlogged and this season's crops are therefore in danger of failing. In the UK, the average size of potatoes was down, and in Italy they lost about 59% of their olive yield. They sound like ""cute"" stories, but both were attributed to more frequent extreme weather affecting the growth of the crops. If the anomalous weather becomes too frequent, the serious issue is obvious. This also affects wild animals, whose food sources will be disrupted.

&amp;#x200B;

~~4. Why we don't see the affects in a lot of the first world:~~

4. How different areas see different affects:

&amp;#x200B;

Should talk about the atmospheric system and how heat is distributed out around the planet from the equator, thus equatorial countries take the brunt. Could possibly bring up the increased rate of expansion of the Sahara. The changes then occurred over approx 10000 years. We're achieving the same increase in as little as 100 years.  

&amp;#x200B;

From /u/Macralicious:  The California wildfires, extreme cold across the Midwest last winter, all of the aforementioned crop growing issues. The reason we don't notice as much (in my opinion) is that most of the first world has relatively mild climates to begin with; the impacts of climate change are felt more in Africa for example because they were closer to the boundary of what's habitable in the first place. They also have lesser resources and infrastructure that would enable them to be robust against, and cope with, the anomalies.

&amp;#x200B;

5. How do we deal with complete discreditors?

&amp;#x200B;

From /u/Wallawallawallawa: Of course there is lobbying of green groups, but that doesn't mean they're wrong. And wouldn't you expect there to be more lobbying by powerful oil interests?""  Exxon instead buried this knowledge and ferociously lobbied against the it. All of this was uncovered by pulitzer prize nominated research journalism.

Genuine Question: 2hy arent the sea levels rising more?,"I obviously know climate change is a serious issue, just trying to understand something. 

You see before and after pictures of the ice caps from like 1970 to now and a massive amount has melted off. Yet the sea level hasn't risen. Yeah, maybe it's risen like 2 inches but all this hysteria of half of America going underwater seems like bullshit. Can someone explain the science as to why the sea levels aren't rising? Or am I just blind and they actually have risen the amount we'd  expect? I'm assuming I'm wrong.",climatechange
Crazy question: Are there any study done on the viability of using an orbital elevator as giant water pump ?,"And the viability of even building one ?
So that we could extract melting ice cap on the pole and use them for, i don't know, trying to kickstart terraforming Mars or something ?  

Since a lot of mad businessmen are more bothered about emigrating to Mars or creating robot overlord (ok, i'm half trolling here). Seriously though, is there any mad scientist actually researching that ?

Since i'm done believing in people managing to vote for some guy in every country that would do something about CO2, any dictator deciding they should think about their grand children... there ain't much more that can be done in time to avoid rising sea. Climate change might be more survivable without 300m rise in the sea level in the next 2 century. And honestly, except for ""magicaly"" making the problem diseapear, i don't see that not happening. And since magic is science, except for a giant orbital water pump, what else is out there ?

BTW, this aint a joke topic but an actual question.

Study - Air temperature changes in the arctic from 1801 to 1920 -,"Link to the study:

https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/joc.1918

This is an overlooked study that comes to very different conclusions about past arctic temperatures than do proxy studies. 

Some key points:

 - ""On average, the Arctic as a whole was colder by 0.8C"" 

(Which is exactly the global rise reported today) 

 - ""Annual mean temperatures in all the 20-year periods and in all climatic regions were colder than today .... Differences generally are less  than  2C""

 - ""significantly colder autumns were observed in the period 1801 – 1860 in comparison with the
period 1861 – 1920."" 

(That lines up perfectly with LIA conditions)

 - ""The  greatest  discrepancies between the real Arctic and the Subarctic occurred in spring. The former was only a little colder than it is at present (by 0.2C), whereas the latter experienced quite significant cooling (by 1.1C)""

(That shows very little change near the pole and greater change in the sub-arctic. So, the spring melt was slower in most years than we see today}

 - ""... Canadian and Baffin Bay regions, where, on average, April was warmer than today by 0.3C. On the other hand, negative differences (−0.3C, i.e. colder conditions than present) were observed in the Atlantic
and Pacific regions.""

(This implies that there is far more regional variability in arctic temperature conditions than is generally noted)

 - ""The results show that air temperatures in the Arctic from 1801 to 1920 were not as exceptionally cold as has been suggested by some analyses of proxy data""

(So, modern reports of a major increase in arctic temperatures are likely exaggerated.)

 - ""Throughout the whole study period, the majority of mean monthly temperatures lie within one [SD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation) from the modern mean.""

(Which means that about 80% of the measurements are within a normal range of temperature variability)

Most significant is the conclusion that the period 1800-60 was colder in all arctic regions than the period 1861-1920. That means that warming was already occurring in the arctic and sub-arctic well before any warming could be attributed to human causes.",climatechange

Climate change in Vietnam,"Hi, as South East Asia is ""deemed"" one of the most affected regions due to the upbringing of climate change recently, my school assigned me to do a project on Climate change adaptation in Vietnam and its affection on the Agriculture due to me being a Vietnamese. So I did some research on this and I want to ask the professionals to evaluate and maybe add to my research on this topic. Thank you. 

 

The downstream of the Mekong River in Vietnam conclude the largest areas to be severely affected by the consequences of ecological crisis. A national institute reported that salt-water intrusion had influenced many areas near Mekong River, the salt-water reached into about 70km mainland with an intensity of around 13-30%. Due to the low surface elevation level, high population density, and high dependencies of agriculture and aquaculture, it would have a severe impact on citizen lives and economics. A study shows that by 2100, sea level would rise by one meter, following that is 10% of the population is affected and an estimated 10% loss on the country GDP (Tran Duc, 2019).

In Ben Tre, a province-owned hydro station has measured to a significant rise of 25cm in sea level and drops in fresh rive outflows. At the same time, 4% salinity was recorded in the Co Chien River from 45-52 km inland in April 2013. The expectation for the 4% salinity up-river would have reached 40km in-land by 2040. This put Ben Tre in an unfavorable condition; it’s a province surrounded water, yet it’s inhabitable due to the lack of fresh water to sustain agricultural growth and human consumption (DANIDA, 2013).

Thua Thien Hue is in a critical state of a possible major natural disaster happening within the impact of climate change in recent years. Its terrain varies significantly from the mountain with a peak elevation of 500-1000m down to the plain with a mere 20m above sea level and the sea on the opposite side. As a result, the province only consists of 54% mainland with a tilt of over 25°; the rest is the oceans. Due to this topography, it is essentially creating a periodically consistent main flood which is separated into 4 main types of floods. Winter floods, Late floods, Early floods, and Summer floods. Collected data shows that major surges occur mostly during winter. (Shaw, 2006).

(Ir)rational fear of excessive resource use,"In parallel with the increasing amounts of GHGs that enter our atmosphere, we are also facing the risk of resource scarcity. This is because we (humans) are exploiting our planet's resources unsustainably. Recently, I've begun to be more considerate of this, and I try to limit myself in how much I ""consume"" on a daily basis. There are many aspects that can be discussed in this regard, but today I would like to focus on excessive water use.

I have lived in regions where water has been scarce, and I have learned to appreciate water more. For instance, I keep my showers short, I seldom use an electronic dishwasher (because I don't have enough dishes to fill it up, and therefore consider it wasteful), and I even avoid flushing the toilet if I only needed to pee. However, it sort of stresses me out when I see my friends and family ""waste"" water by taking very long showers (sometimes twice a day), using the dishwasher with only a few plates in (even when plates have only had dry bread crumbs on them), and flushing after every single visit to the toilet.

I know that one argument that can be used is ""well, a kg of meat uses X liters of water, so me taking a shower doesn't really matter"", and I understand and accept this as the harsh reality. However, my anxiety is more because the water we use in our homes are local resources (whereas the beef may have been produced on a different continent), and I am, I would say, ""afraid"" of running out of resources because people are wasteful. 

What are your thoughts on this? How can I get people to appreciate the resources we have and motivate them to use less, without coming across as an A-hole?",climatechange

The Power of Hope and it’s effect on human motivation.,"Hi all!

This is my first post on here, I came here after reading an extremely frightening report on climate change. 

Amongst all the doom and gloom I feel I must observe that throughout history, there have been many scenarios that have seemed hopeless, this might even be the biggest. However we have frequently overcame seemingly insurmountable odds due to hope, ingenuity and the strength of the human spirit. With the universe out there, the solutions exist. 

A social tipping point is coming, progress has new reinforcements everyday while the powers that oppose progress fight a war on two fronts, with progress and the grave. 

If we can all raise awareness and be prepared to begin an industrial and economic green revolution within the next five years we have a chance, we still have the exponential growth of technology to contribute to our efforts. Our futures here CAN be saved, and I have every confidence that they WILL BE. If you don’t have faith in anything else, have faith in the Power of Hope. 

Just to illustrate my point, with exception of those with no means of accessing the knowledge that our climate is changing for the worse, all the most intelligent people in the world across 100s of fields and in nearly all places believe in climate change, so when it comes down to it something will be attempted and it will and should be on a massive scale. 

Good luck everyone!",climatechange
My Opinion,"Most of the people around me in my daily life don’t care about climate change whatsoever. However, I personally find it quite disturbing. The thought of a changing globe and the conflicts and problems that come with it, such as rising oceans and and increased extreme weather events make me feel guilty for being one of the contributors to such a horrendous event.
  
Global warming is almost definitely going to happen, and even the naysayers must agree that any work done to prevent climate change could only lead to a healthier planet in the long run. Yet many people choose to ignore al the evidence piling up, such as rising temperatures, sea levels, increased numbers of extreme weather events, and the fact that all these seem to coincide with the massive amounts of greenhouse gases we release into the atmosphere every year. 

I have decided that I will try and reduce my own emissions if no one near me will, if not to set an example then to simply reduce my own guilt. I will reduce the amount of meat I eat and the emissions I emit by driving by using active and public transportation more frequently, as my current lifestyle doesn’t follow a “healthier planet” vision. 

                                                                          Caden",climatechange
Carbon pricing for other green house gasses,"How would carbon pricing for methane (86 GWP/20yr), HCF (3790 GWP/20yr), CFC (7020 GWP/20yr), N2O (269 GWP/20yr), and CF4 (4950 GWP/20yr) work?
I chose the 20 year global warming potential because it’s crunch time right now, and we have about 12 years to make serious change, but the values change a lot when talking about 100 year GWP. For carbon pricing of emissions, how would you go about doing it for these other greenhouse gases? Do you have people pay 84 times as much for methan emissions, or 34, which is the 100 year GWP. New reports show industrial methane emissions are a lot higher than expected and also seems like some factories in China are relseasing CFC’s into the environment. Any info or ideas about this would be greatly appreciated!",climatechange

What types of man made or natural events would cause a huge jump in global temps?,"Hi all!

&amp;#x200B;

So, I'm writing a book that is set 100 years from now (well, 90ish years). It's got dystopic and apocalyptic themes.. and I was wondering what types of environmental changes would occur in 100 years. I'd like to have the environment play a neat effect in my book, man vs nature, all that jazz. But if it's out of the realm of plausible fiction... then I'll cut that idea.

&amp;#x200B;

**So as for the real question, I was just curious as to what types of events-- any! it could be man-made, environmental, or totally fictional!-- would cause global temperatures to jump to a point that it would change the world around us -- sea levels rising, crops and overall agriculture being affected.** 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm writing in the overall history of my universe right now. My setting is North America, most specifically the Midwest and moving east. I've created a 2030 map that has the US, Canada, and Mexico borders... but i also made a general 2109 map.. where I've made some guesses as to sea levels rising (to a point want as a writer), and I changed country borders and such. 

&amp;#x200B;

All of this to say, I'm trying to map out the changes in North America and I need some guidelines from people who are smarter than me lmao.",climatechange
Looking for advice on planning for my families future,"I don’t know where else to post this but I need some sort of guidance so I can sleep better at night. We currently live in the south Tampa region of Florida. We have decent jobs along with a couple investment properties. I thought I did my due diligence a couple years ago with the rising water, the expected flooding etc. I don’t think I dug deep enough... I honestly don’t think I really wanted to until now. 
    A recent Brookings Institute report projects that the Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater region is the second-most vulnerable metro in the U.S. to the monetary consequences of climate change. By 2050 Tampa is projected to have a temperature of over 105 degrees for 119 days out of the year. 
   I work outside everyday and my families business is based on working outside. Do we run for the hills before people start to wise up? Most people I talk to down here do not think there is any sort of problem or they think the projections are way worse than what will actually happen. Our current plan is to save every penny for the next 7-10 years and move. The anxiety I have from this is unreal.",climatechange

Those cycles are rather well mapped, even though there are other variables less well known, especially with respect to our galactic orbit and regions of interstellar dust. If we hadn't poured so much CO2 into the atmosphere, where would be, roughly, best guess? Still in a cooling phase, or still warming from the last ice age? If we are supposed to be on a cooling trajectory, our heating planet takes on new significance, and if we are in a natural warming phase, then we are doubly screwed.",climatechange

What ive learned about climate change from social media,"Researching solely about climate change from Reddit, here is what ive learned about climate change and my thoughts/viewpoints about it.

__What have you found out about climate change?__

I have found that climate change has become an issue that most people don't usually think about in their daily lives.

Climate change affects not only humans, but wildlife and vegetation. This has been shown through the extinction of certain species.

__What conclusions have you made?__

I have concluded that the affects of climate change are everywhere and people need to change their lifestyles because of it.

__What did you base your conclusions off of?__

I based my conclusion from what I've seen in my every day life, and from what I've seen happens when we continue to cause climate change from our own actions.

__How do your actions affect climate change?__

My actions affect climate change by a small amount, things like not using single use plastics and reducing our energy use. What makes a difference is advising our friends, family, community, and more about what they can do to prevent climate change. If we all change the way we live, (reduce the amount of fossil fuels burned by using more efficient furnaces,etc.) We can make a change.",climatechange
A place for Crowd Sourcing climate change solutions?,I was wondering if there’s an irl or online space where professionals communicate the issues they’re having in developing (for example) carbon capture tech or better batteries or trying to solve the issue of energy consistency and peak usage. Essentially I’m wondering if there’s a place where the public and professionals can gather to collaborate to find solutions for climate change. Most potential answers are probably going to be stupid. But just maybe there’s an idea that’s a diamond in the rough. IMO The best think tank is a think tank with the collective knowledge of millions of people.,climatechange

Won’t global warming cause more clouds?,"Since the earth is heating up, won’t it cause more water from the ocean to evaporate and therefore create more clouds that reflect the suns light and heat, thus cooling the earth again? Then wouldn’t this sort of start an oscillating pattern of heating and cooling? (Sorry if this has been asked before btw).",climatechange
clean energy question,"Okay so here's the deal, both my grandfathers are very accomplished physicists. While one worked primarily with composites and material science in the French aerospace industry and later NASA and has friends who have worked in nuclear physics. The other has an impressive array of publications in thermo mechanics, collisions etc... mainly in the civil engineering area, namely roads. In the past he has worked on an US/FRA exchange program with the Los Alamos laboratory to compare and exchange data in nuclear physics (probably bombs), he has met original scientists from the Manhattan project including Oppenheimer unless I'm very much mistaken and is good friends with Robert Dautray who is the father of the French bomb.

Both of are pro nuclear and believe nuclear energy is the cleanest we have and will have for a long time to come and considering their background and wealth of knowledge I can't see any reason to not believe them. Having done my own research I believe a combination of nuclear and hydro electric power would be a perfect to have clean renewable energy. So why are law makers backing out of nuclear so much when it is the safest cleanest energy we have available. Heck if I remember my figures correctly Germany's emissions went UP when they stopped the 'reactors. France and Sweden continue to have very low carbon emissions from their power plants for these reasons.

"""There is a runaway train racing toward us, and its name is climate change""...is not a scientific fact, it's the opposite","Recently a journalistic conference was convened in America (jointly by the *Columbia Journalism Review* and the *The Nation*) to survey the state of American journalism on climate change. 

Criticisms of US coverage abounded — but the criticisms also abounded with errors. In the keynote article ""[The Media Are Complacent While the World Burns](https://www.cjr.org/special_report/climate-change-media.php)"" one finds this passage:

&gt;There is a runaway train racing toward us, and its name is climate change. That is not alarmism; it is scientific fact. 

This statement is definitely NOT a statement of scientific fact — which doesn't deal in metaphors like runaway trains. The statement qualifies as magical thinking at least, and probably alarmism too.

Conference participants presumably had some more substantive criticisms of US climate coverage. Although I bet hardly any of them were more substantive than Chris Hayes' observation from 2018:

&gt; Hayes (who is an editor at large for *The Nation*) replied that his program had tried. Which was true: in 2016, “All In With Chris Hayes” spent an entire week highlighting the impact of climate change in the US as part of a look at the issues that Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump were ignoring. The problem, Hayes tweeted, was that “every single time we’ve covered [climate change] it’s been a palpable ratings killer. So the incentives are not great.”

American journalism covers climate in three distinct ways: 

1) Validating the beliefs of the Climate Denier audience, with the most spectacular assertions one can find which possess a minimum amount of scientific support.  

2) Validating the beliefs of the Climate Doomer audience, with the most spectacular assertions one can find which possess a minimum amount of scientific support. This is what's happening with the ""runaway train"" quote here.

3) Serving the audience which is actually interested in the science of climate. This audience doesn't have many beliefs which go beyond what can be shown by analytic methods. The real task of this strain of journalism is to expand the range of what can be shown by analytic methods. It's probably best to call this strain ""(actual) science journalism,"" rather than mainstream journalism.

It's stupid to fault American journalism (or any journalism) for serving the first two audiences. That's the explicit task of much mainstream journalism: To serve and form a relationship with the largest audience they can reach. Many people are more interested in having their beliefs validated than in having them analyzed (or challenged). These audiences will always exist.

The real question is: How large is that third audience? Is there a chance that it might grow to the size of the other two? If it does, then mainstream journalism will have to yield some space to more ""(actual) science journalism.""

But the keynote article for the CJR/Nation conference gives me no hope that *that* particular set of journalism watchers intends to take a single step in that direction. They're in the validating-beliefs mode, not the analytical mode. 

Plenty of analytical-mode writers publish all the time. There's no need to pay a single moment's attention to the largest mainstream outlets (for instance, network television news operations). But you have to search for them. And complaining about the belief-validating sections of the media doesn't actually make the search easier.",climatechange
Guardian Article: Humans and volcanoes caused nearly all of global heating in past 140 years,"[The article](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/30/humans-and-volcanoes-caused-nearly-all-of-global-heating-in-past-140-years) discusses a recent [study](https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/10.1175/JCLI-D-18-0555.1) on the contributions of humans and nature to early 20th century warming. The article also cites Judith Curry. I'd be interested to hear what the sub thinks and, if possible, shed some insight on the role of this early century warming in the science.

Also, the study's co-author is Friederike Otto, who's made a bit of a splash recently on German television as the poster child of ""Attribution Science"" (i.e. real-time assessments of the likelihood of extreme weather events being attributable to climate change) and I was wondering whether anyone had any thoughts on this.

How can an individual engineer have the biggest impact on climate change? (x-post from /r/askengineers),"Hey, looking for a little advice for a friend.  She has a driving need to work to reverse climate change and is trying to figure out the best way to do that.  Do you have any advice for what could be the way that she can have the most impact?

&amp;#x200B;

She has a masters in EE from a top-tier university and has been working in hardware validation for a couple years.  She's also a capable programmer and has been shifting her role to include more CS.  But her current job has nothing to do with the environment or climate change, and she's finding it to be quite a drag.

&amp;#x200B;

Right now, her (incomplete) plan is to go back to school to study chemical engineering, then use that degree as a way to get a job in clean tech.  The long-term goal is to work on carbon capture or trying to remove plastics from the ocean.  It seems to me there are a lot of unknown and undefined steps in her plan.

&amp;#x200B;

So here are a few of my questions:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

1. What's the best way for a young, capable engineer to have an impact on climate change work?
2. Is a degree in chemical engineering a good first step, or would it be a waste of time?
3. What are some companies or organizations where she could work to have an impact?  Preference for the SF Bay Area, but not a limiting factor.  Startups welcome.

This suggests that the current total carbon emissions by McDonald's is known. I can't seem to find this kind of information though anywhere, so I'm not sure where the article got these numbers.

A Deep Dive into Solar Panels.,"12.3 million. The number of homes solar panels were able to power in the US at the end of 2018. Whenever conferring with others about the energy source of the future, solar energy is almost always brought alight. Solar energy is rapidly expanding around the world, as the push for clean energy spreads across the globe. Behind solar energy are solar panels: the panels that absorb sunlight as a source of energy to create electricity for our needs. Ever since 1839, solar panels have been changing constantly and improving greatly to better coincide with the push for 100% clean, renewable energy. The talk around solar panels for the future of the world is undeniably a great amount, but it is also important to acknowledge the history of solar panels, how they work, and their current day status. 
 
Solar energy has been around ever since ancient civilization, but it wasn’t anything like the conventional solar panels seen today used to harness the sun’s energy. It wasn’t until the 1800s when the ball got rolling and solar energy was starting to form like a newly born star in the solar system. Solar energy all started based off an earth-shattering 1839 discovery found by French physicist, Edmond Becquerel. This discovery consisted of the finding of the photovoltaic effect, “a process that generates voltage or electric current in a photovoltaic cell when it is exposed to sunlight,” as Energy Education puts it. Additionally, the discovery of the photovoltaic effect was found while Becquerel was conducting research with a cell comprised of metal electrodes in a conducting solution. Consequently, Becquerel would exclaim, “shining light on an electrode submerged in a conductive solution would create an electric current,” in reference to discovering the photovoltaic effect. Later, in 1873, Willoughby Smith stumbled upon the photoconductivity of selenium, now used in solar panels today. Moreover, in 1876, William Grylls Adams and Richard Evans Day put the photovoltaic idea (originally found by Becquerel) to selenium, finding it could generate electricity when light hit it. To no one’s surprise, someone would eventually put all three discoveries to life which is exactly what happened in 1883, when Charles Fritts created the first ever working selenium cell. Charles Fritts’ newly made cell was an ingenious invention at the time, as he hoped it would compete with Edison’s coal-fired power plants. On the contrary, the new, innovative selenium cell was less than 1% efficient and had no chance of competing with Edison’s coal-fired power plants as the solar cell wasn’t a feasible way of powering millions of peoples lives. Generally, the idea of solar energy wasn’t a popular one at the time and wouldn’t be for a while. Eventually, the concept of solar energy was brought alight when Albert Einstein published a paper on the photoelectric effect and how light carries energy, happening in 1905. Hence, Albert Einstein would win The Nobel Prize in Physics 1921, “For his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect.” He would receive the prize a year later, in 1922.
 
 With the concept of solar energy gaining steam, more specifically the photoelectric and photovoltaic effect, it wasn’t until 1941 when Russell Ohl broke the barrier and invented the solar cell; different than the selenium cell invented by Charles Fritts in 1883. Similarly, like Fritts’ selenium cell, the new solar cell invented by Russell Ohl was incredibly ineffective and not a feasible option to power the lives of many at the time. The energy conversion efficiency of the cell was only 1%, thus for every 100 Joules of solar energy hitting the cell, only 1 Joule of electrical energy was created. While this was an improvement from Fritts’ cell, it wasn’t enough to be used as a legitimate source of energy worldwide, as previously mentioned. The most groundbreaking, substantial invention didn’t come until 1954, when the modern day photovoltaic cell was invented by Daryl Chapin, Calvin Fuller, and Gerald Pearson. After months of long, grueling work, the final product was the first feasible silicon cell ever invented. Originally, Daryl Chapin wanted to make a source of power for telephone systems in remote areas, therefore turning to solar energy as the option. He would later collaborate with Calvin Fuller and Gerald Pearson, as they all invented the cell in unity. Truly, this was the cell of the future as the newly invented cell had a 6% conversion efficiency, much more than the 1941 solar cell invented by Russell Ohl or the 1883 selenium cell invented by Charles Fritts. In fact, the solar call had so much potential The New York Times wrote the newly invented silicon cell, “may mark the beginning of a new era, leading eventually to the realization of one of mankind’s most cherished dreams–the harnessing of the almost limitless energy of the sun for the uses of civilization.” Even though the cell was way too costly at the time to be used by the public or companies (the solar cells costed over $100 per watt), the US military decided to fund research on the cells for the potential to power satellites in the 1950s. The funding persited, and the first ever spacecraft to use solar panels ended up being the Vanguard I in 1958. For some time, solar was still too costly for use until Dr. Elliot Berman did extensive research and was able to produce a much less expensive solar cell, bringing the cost per watt down to just $20, in the early 1970s. Coincidentally, in 1973, the energy crisis hit the US which made oil prices skyrocket forcing the US to turn to other energy options, like solar. In turn, this made the US government committed to developing solar energy (solar panels in specific) as a feasible source of energy for future uses. As a result, Jimmy Carter decided to install solar panels on the roof of the White House to spread awareness and to make a solar energy statement. Evidently, solar panels started to become more feasible as the “golden era” of solar panels for the 1900s hit in the 1980s. 
 
During the 1980s, solar panels started to become much more efficient and cheaper through research and developments. By the 1990s, many groundbreaking creations came out which helped fuel solar panel growth. For example, in 1992, the University of South Florida developed a 15.9% efficient thin-film photovoltaic cell made of cadmium telluride. Just a short time after, in 1994, the first ever solar cell exceeding 30% conversion efficiency was made. 5 years later, in 1999, a photovoltaic solar cell was developed that converted 32.3% of the sunlight that hits it into electricity. Also in 1999,  the new efficiency record for photovoltaic thin-film solar cells was hit marking in at 18.8%. In total, growth between the 1980s and 1990s was crucial to solar panels expanding. Just in 1983, the worldwide photovoltaic production was 21.3 megawatts. In 1999, that number increased to 1,000 megawatts. In conclusion, it is clear the history of solar panels was jammed packed and certainly fascinating indeed. 
 
Today, solar panels work in a very specific way. For solar panels to work, sunlight must be hitting the panel. Obviously, if there is no sun, the solar panels won’t be working at that specific moment. This is why at night, solar panels aren’t working like they are in the day. Anyway, soon after the sun hits the panel, the photovoltaic solar cell absorbs the radiation from the sun. For the sun to hit the cell, it must go through the frame, glass, and encapsulant which makes up the solar panel. Once the sun does hit the cell, after passing through the first stages of the solar panel, electrons begin to move around internally. Nevertheless, a solar cell consists of a layer of p-type silicon placed next to a layer of n-type silicon which are sandwiched between two silicon layers. Inside the n-type, there is an excess of electrons while inside the p-type, there is an excess of positively charged holes. Between the n-type silicon layer and the p-type silicon layer, there is the depletion zone where electrons fill the holes. Once this is completed, the p-type of the depletion zone now contains negatively charged ions while the n-type consists of positively charged ions. Moreover, this creates an electric field which prevents electrons in the n-type layer to fill the holes in the p-type layer. Finally, when sunlight hits the cell, electrons in the holes are ejected resulting in the formation of the holes. All in all, when the p-type and n-type layers are connected with metallic wire or any wire that can generate electric current, the electrons will travel from the sides creating electricity. In a residential solar makeup, the solar panels convert the sunlight into DC energy which is then transferred to an inverter which transfers the electricity to AC for use. For all energy not needed, it goes back to the grid. In conclusion, solar panels aren’t too complicated and work following a basic method. Without the method present, solar panels wouldn’t be able to function as they do. 
 
In today’s era, solar panels are becoming increasingly more prominent and have been over the last few years. In the last decade alone, solar has experienced an average annual growth rate of 50% amongst the US. Furthermore, there are currently over 240,000 Americans working in the solar industry with over 10,000 companies per state. In discussion with cost, the cost to install solar has rapidly dropped by more than 70% in the last decade with the average price per watt only being anywhere from $2.67 to $3.43 now. Comparing the prices to 70 years ago, there is a huge difference in cost. Currently, most solar is installed in Europe and East Asia which account for over 70% of global installations. The least happens to be in Africa, accounting for less than 1% of total global installations. Installations have been growing like wildfire ever since a jump in 2010. In 2000, there were no installations of solar in the US whatsoever. By 2016, the yearly installation reached almost 14,000 watts across residential PV (photovoltaic), non-residential PV, Utility PV, and Utility CSP. The US has also been emphasizing solar, with the annual additions of new electric capacity always growing each year ever since 2010. In 2010, that number was just 4%. In 2018, it was 29% out of all possible energies. Nevertheless, in the US, California has been a big player in solar with the most installations out of any state coming from California. In fact, California beats the next 9 states combined in terms of annual residential PV installations. By January 1st, 2020, California is making it mandatory for all new homes to come installed with solar panels. In terms of efficiency, most solar panels have above 20% conversion levels now. There are actually 7 different types of solar panels, with different types varying per company. Finally, solar panels can be found in solar farms, on residential homes, and commercial homes primarily. It is good to note solar farms are the most effective ways for solar panels to work and the most prominent way. To illustrate how solar is truly on the rise, the global solar energy sector is projected to reach $422 billion by 2022 up from $86 billion in 2016, according to Allied Market Research. In conclusion, it is clear solar panels are on the rise and becoming the energy choice of the future. Within 10 years, solar will have expanded greatly around the world like it has in the past 10. 
 
Clearly, the history of solar panels is quite eventful, the way they work is very fascinating and complex, and their current day status is very promising. Without solar panels in life, the world would suffer major losses without one of the most popular clean energy options around. Not only this, renewable energy would have to be limited to the current day, less promising options like wind energy. Jobs would also be lost, the economy wouldn’t be the same, and solar companies would seize to exist. In a world without solar panels, what would it be like?

"Supercritical CO2, closed loop Geothermal wells and the promise of universal carbon free base load Renewable power","Yesterday I posted a link to  DOE review of the untapped potential of Geothermal power Plants.  this post is in response to questions posed in comments to that post.

Here are a number of links that will help explain the potential of supercritical CO2 and as I see it, its incredible potential if applied in closed loop Geothermal wells to provide base load Renewable power while sequestering the CO2 working fluids required to drive the power plants.

**How much CO2 might be sequestered in a** **closed loop Geothermall well**

**With a closed loop system, that would be 10,000 feet of 4” pipe holding**  **6531 gallons of CO2, or at 8.8lbs/gallon, that is more than 57,000 lbs or more than 28 tons of CO2 stored as the working fluid in a single**  **closed loop**  **geothermal well – essentially creating a new market for capturing waste CO2.** **Most Geothermal wells have much larger working diameters.**",climatechange
"As a layman, I believe the main killer of climate change will be all the wars it spurs","I've always said the science behind global climate change, appears to pretty solid, and to me talking to a climate change denier is like debating a flat earther.

I want to run this idea past a couple people on here.

Basically Homo Sapiens is 200,000 years old. Besides maybe ideology, and religion, what has been a main motivating factor for wars? Limited resources, and power and control over those resources. When I play Civ V, I gotta delay my civilization's progress if I aim to take out another, but on a cost/benefit analysis that rival civilization's resources are main motivating factor. And I think we got a similar situation here.

We got 7.6 billion people. Population numbers continuing to rise. This can NOT rise indefinitely. And not when climate change is actually going to affect land areas, I.E. where humans live, profoundly more than out in the middle of the ocean, I suspect land is actually going to get a lot hotter than say 4c.

It's not so much the farm lands being turned to desert and displacement of hundreds of millions from coastal cities that scares me...I think this climate change is going to set off potentially the proverbial WWIII. You're gonna have starving masses similar to Soylent Green, they're going to be pissed. We're seeing the rise of nationalists, I'm not getting into politics, but basically instead of humans figuring out a way to share the earth's resources for their survival, they're looking to horde them to themselves. It's the rise of authoritarianism and a look to strong man dictatorships in major countries, that is leading me to see parallel's to the lead up to the WWII situation, except today's weapons are profoundly more destructive than they were in the 1940's.

IIRC they say one of the reasons we may have yet to ever discover intelligent life is because it figured out how to destroy itself, before it figured out interstellar travel. Right now we got the nuclear arsenal the world over to destroy ourselves as opposed to interstellar travel.

So I just wanted to see what others think of this idea of mine.",climatechange

Why are some people so resolutely opposed to accepting climate change,"i have been posting on many topics  on a different forum for quite a while.  I have done a few posts on climate change. And have noticed that many people are seemingly irrationally opposed to consideration of evidence on the topic.

The most recent topic that i chose was sea level rise. I chose this topic because it seemed to me that the evidence of sea level rise is indisputable.  Not only are sea levels rising, they are rising at an accelerating rate.   ( from 1.8 mm per year in 1900 to about 3.5 mm per year recently)  I asked a simple question:  what is causing this phenomenon?

To me, the only possible explanation is added heat from greenhouse gasses.   But i was open to any alternative explanation that might be proposed.  I got answers like... sedimentation is causing sea level rise, and seismic activity may be reducing the size of ocean basins.  Both of these explanations are easily dismissed since they are long term and constant and therefore could not account for a short term acceleration of sea level rise.  I have had someone argue that in order to accept air temperature readings there would have to be millions  of ground stations all read by a single individual. I have had people argue that any co2 mitigation strategy... no matter how small... would result in the collapse of the world economy. And of course there is the persistent meme that all of the scientists in the world are part if a gigantic plot that requires that the keep producing phony studies in order to line their pockets with government grants.

I have to say that the people proposing these arguments are clearly intelligent, and not obviously insincere.   I find it confounding that they seem to be so rooted in their opposition to this topic that no amount of patience, or rationality will dislodge them from their intractable opposition to open minded consideration of the evidence.

How does irrigation affect the climate?,"Water is one of the most important things related to the climate, but I've hardly ever heard talk about irrigation and climate change. But surely irrigation has an effect one way or another, about 2,700,000,000,000,000 liters of water are used for irrigation. Water vapor is a powerful greenhouse gas but precipitates out quickly; clouds, snow, and ice have high albedo; water weathers rocks absorbing CO2; water helps plants absorb CO2; irrigating areas changes their albedo; plants release water via evapotranspiration. 

An example of water vapor being dependent on land use is the Amazon rainforest, which is mostly self-watering by absorbing and transpiring rainwater. Farmland also changes the local water vapor concentration, by irrigating, by forming the land to absorb water rather than have runoff, and by changing rates of evapotranspiration compared to wildland.

Irrigation causes a lot of huge changes, some of which cancel each other. Anyone know what the net effect is?",climatechange

Food Towers as a Method to Futureproof?,"Guys,
I've been thinking, and this is what I've thought. As it stands, all we need in life is food, water and shelter, and efficiency is key. I believe the society we live in (I speak as an Australian) is geared towards burning energy to stimulate an economy. Without business, managing the cost of living would become near impossible and many would suffer. The problem I forsee is that the business we promote is unsustainable for the environment and also for ourselves, and we will ultimately run ourselves into the ground. 

[tldr] So here is my idea... Why don't we condense our populus into towers, each of which can support its own capacity of residents through hydroponics. I fear we will be forced to retreat indoors if we leave this climate change issue for too long, and this is a solution I believe could work. 

I would love to hear from each and every one of you, with your thoughts about this and ideas on the topic.

All the best",climatechange
Idea I had,"Remember in 2014 when people were posting video’s of them emptying a bucket of ice over their head everywhere for ALS and people all around the world started doing it and nominating their friends?
What if we started something similar, like for example someone plants a tree, posts pictures of it on social media and nominates their friends to do the same.
The main excuse people have when you ask them why they don’t eat less meat or something like that is that one person isn’t going to save the world. This challenge fixes that problem, as planting just one tree and nominating your friends who in turn nominate other people can create a huge chain reaction.
I’m just curious to know if something like this is doable and what you guys think about this idea.",climatechange

How does CO2 causes earth to heat up?,"Does anyone have good scientific facts on how CO2 causes global warming?

Air is 21% oxygen, 78% nitrogen and 0.04% CO2. CO2 has gone from 300 ppm to  415 ppm in last century and could get to  500ppm soon. While this is a huge increase in CO2 it is still a very small fraction of the air.  There is not much difference in 0.04% and 0.05%

For sure CO2 gas is a better insulator than  nitrogen or  oxygen. I believe O and N  have r value of about 0.97 per inch while CO2 is 1.5.  However given the small percentage of CO2 in the air,  i suspect it would not change the overall insulation properties of air.

CO2 can absorb infrared radiation whereas oxygen and nitrogen do not. However, again since CO2 makes up such a small fraction of air, I can't see this making huge change in earth's temperature.

The most interesting theories I have heard relate to how CO2 amplifies the amount of  water vapour that air can hold. Since water vapor and clouds have a huge effect on earths temperature this sounds more plausible. The only way I understand how C02 effects water vapour is that CO2 will warm the air, thus warm air holds more moisture. Again we are back to the small percentage of CO2 and could that small percentage have a large impact on the airs moisture content. Maybe there are other interactions at play.

How do we know Earth's orbital patterns are not effecting climate change more than humans?,"I know I might get some flack here, and I think we should be doing everything we can to stop the hazardous pollution of our planet, but I am just not convinced it is solely humans that are responsible for the current warming we are seeing. In my recent research I have come across many other natural processes that could lead to the warming of our planet. The history of the climate of this planet is actually far from stable, as only 10,000 years ago, our planet was in a full blown ice age, that we still don't fully understand how it got out of. The orbit of the earth is also very diverse. Aside from the regular orbit and rotation on its axis that cause the 4 seasons, there are factors such as milankovitch cycles, axial obliquity, axial &amp; apsidal precession, and eccentricity to name a few, that could all be effecting how the heat from the sun is dispersed on the surface of our planet, just in a much more subtle way (every 10,000-100,000 years or so).

Another thing is the natural release of CO2 from pockets in the ice, or from volcanic eruptions that release millions of tons of CO2 into the atmosphere in a matter of hours or days.

I would like to reiterate that I think we should be doing everything we can to stop the destructive pollution of our planet. I just think we need to be looking at the bigger picture of climate change as a whole to fully understand the problem we are facing.",climatechange
i’m mad about this crappy climate change organization / thoughts on approaching the climate change discussion,"sorry in advance, i really needed to rant.

Today i went to an interview with this organization (rather not name it) that basically advertises itself as on the forefront of fighting climate change, etc. it was advertised as a summer job for students. so first red flag, the job is fundraising, going from house to house to get money. i would get to keep about half. feels a little dirty to me. that is the whole job. talking to people about climate change and asking for money, and then keeping half. oh also if i don’t hit a certain quota per day they don’t have to pay me. so i’m basically working off commission. okay, i’m thinking, this organization needs money to see change happen, i guess i’ll just do my best in the interview and see what happens. 

so i go to the interview. the questions are very forceful and i don’t feel like the woman respects me very much. she nods her head at certain answers and makes small facial indications that she doesn’t like what i’m saying at other times. one thing really jumps out at me: she asks me what i would say to these people to inform them of how important climate change is. i say “well, we’re all in this together and we all need to act to see change happen for us. everyone is affected by this. we need to make sure we’re making the right personal decisions like switching to electric cars for instance and also the right public decisions such as voting and supporting climate change campaigns.” she immediately says “well this isn’t the people’s fault. it’s the industries and the government” and essentially says it’s not up to us (?????) she didn’t say “oh but that isn’t the focus of this campaign” or “but when you talk to people stick to talking about the public side.” no. she literally said essentially that personal decisions don’t make a difference for climate change. i didn’t really know what to do cause i didn’t want to be rude so i kind of nodded. 

then at the end of the interview she said maybe a full paragraph about how many other candidates there were and how qualified they all were and how i had seen them when i was waiting and how they needed to get people on the team fast and that they were actually hiring that very day and then extended the job offer. i was kind of flustered and she pressured me a lot and so i was just like “yes i accept” and agreed to starting the next day and walked out of there feeling super weird and like i had been almost forced into it against my will.

then i was thinking about how weird the whole thing was and i ended up talking with both my parents and they agreed that it seemed kind of fishy and also because i would be commuting (v expensive) i literally could not afford if i didn’t make the quota one day so i figured it’s not worth it to even try because i would lose so much money just by giving it a shot and i could lose a ton of a money even if i did make the quota for a long time. anyways so i decide to call them and say i changed my mind, i felt bad but i also didn’t feel that bad cause i felt i had kind of been pressured into it with no time to think about it. so i call.

so this is the part that really pissed me off. i call to tell them i’m backing out. he says “why, do you not believe in the cause? is climate change not important to you?” and i said “no, it is, but i don’t think i can afford the commute.” and he says, “well we have people who commute from [place farther away than where i live]. isn’t where you live closer?” and i said “yes but this isn’t the right time for me to do this” and he said “well the point of no return is in 12 years, when is gonna be the right time for you?” and then he kept talking about how much the organization is doing to combat climate change and basically asking me if i didn’t care at all, extremely patronizing questions and i eventually said “i respect what you guys are doing but i can’t take the job right now.” 

i hung up from that phone call so angry. i’m so angry right now. i can’t believe this supposedly reputable organization would use tactics like that to keep me in. i’m so glad i got out when i did because they probably would have been just as manipulative if i actually worked with them.

okay, so first of all, how could that woman, the freaking director of this program, possibly say that personal actions have nothing to do with it??? is that just how she sleeps at night? like i don’t understand. how could someone who’s supposed to care about this issue actually say that? it freaking astounds me that that person exists, that people like that could exist. it is everyone that is responsible for climate change. individuals, governments, industry, infrastructure. most parts of the developed world have been built off the backs of fossil fuels. you can’t just turn only corporations into the enemy, or only demand change from the government and that’s it. that is such a freaking victim mentality, such a disempowered position to put yourself in. why would anyone do that expect to feel okay about not trying in their personal life?? i watched a video from hank green (vlogbrothers, i think it was called what game of thrones is really about) talking about how we have ALL benefitted from fossil fuel use. modern society exists today because of fossil fuel use. it’s not about demonizing a certain sect of humanity. it’s about actually moving towards a cleaner and brighter future where we can ALL coexist. demonizing certain people or peoples is not sustainable (no pun intended.) it is only a way to feel better about ourselves. and this is ultimately extremely selfish. we HAVE to take personal responsibility. it is the only way. we have to be humble enough to realize that we are part of the problem too. 

second of all, why would they fucking try to guilt me into staying? what a dumb way to get campaigners. at this point i almost feel like it’s some sort of scam, except that it was with this pretty reputable organization and i’m so angry that they would treat me like that. what i’m most angry about is that it worked. it made me feel like a shitty person. not because i am or think i am but because that’s how he was treating me. this CANNOT be part of the climate change campaign. when we weaponize morality like this, when we say you’re bad for not caring about this. it turns people off. no one is going to listen to you if you’re patronizing in that way. no one is going to listen to someone that talks down to them. person to person respect is the most important part of moving such a huge campaign like this along. WHY would we try to manipulate people? this problem is so real, we have to let the truth speak for itself. trying to manipulate people literally undermines the truth and gravity of the situation. it makes it underhanded instead of honorable to talk about this. we have to find a way to reach people about this without saying they’re bad for not caring about it in the past. i want to make it clear: if you didn’t know or care about climate change before, there should be no judgment on you. by the same token you’re not a “good” person for caring about it. it’s going to kill us. stop trying to pretend your survival instincts make you a saint. (no offense. like we need people who care about it, of course, and like i said i think there is an honor in it. it just pisses me off when people act like they’re above other people for caring about it.) can we stop putting people into categories of good and bad??? this issue is too important for anyone to put their ego into it. it’s not about me or you or anyone else. it’s about how we’re aLL GOING TO DIE! we need to give this issue the respect it deserves. it doesn’t need manipulation. our voices need to be a medium to spread the message, not a way to make us feel self righteous. 

if you’ve made it this far, damn, and thanks. i don’t usually post rants like this but i don’t think i could have let this stupid situation go without getting it out of my system. do you have any thoughts?",climatechange

help choosing between the outdated AR4 Scenarios,"  

Dear climate change community, 

I have a bit of an academic situation and I wanted to know your opinion regarding the subject.  I am a PhD Student, I am doing my PhD in Sustainable Environmental  Architectural Design in the tropics. Anyhow, the thing is I am using this software called Meteonorm  ( [https://meteonorm.com/en/](https://meteonorm.com/en/) ) to generate a series of weather files to generate a territorial climate zoning using the Koeppen method but changing the years of the climate normals, first from 1981 to 1990, then 1991 to 2012 and then a prediction for 2060. My problem is, even though the software is a recent updated version, the thing still uses the AR4 IPCCs scenarios from 2007, thus in order to generate the future files, one must choose between the scenarios B1, A1B and A2. 

At the beginning I had no doubt in using the A2 Scenario, since the last year IPCC special report of Global warming of 1.5°C was a bit alarming and I thought the temperature ranges (2.0 to 5.4 °C) seem to fit on the 100 year predictions, but then I read a paper from 2015 ([https://www.nature.com/articles/srep09957](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep09957) )  which I understood that the most likely scenario was A1B and it made sense, but some years have gone by and thins have evolved a lot in the last years, I understand the AR4 is a bit outdated and the latest reports offer a better and more detailed prediction of what we may encounter but, what would be your recommendation regarding the subject, do you thing conditions may have changed and the A2 is more likely than the A1B? or the A1B still fit the range of possibilities?

Thanks for your time,",climatechange

Then, sometimes I try to focus on the positives: the amazing work being done to clean up our planet, the steps we are taking in the right direction, and the fact that IF we can stave off complete annihilation we will have made a world that I actually will want to live in.

Since they're growing naturally this seems the best thing to do as buying or getting others would require more CO2 emissions to get the trees but I wondered if there was a more 'efficient' tree to grow that I could get easily.

How exactly is climate change an existential threat?,"I'm fully prepared for people to roast me for even asking, but I'm trying to be thoughtful about this issue...


I'm all for being prepared for, or better yet, trying to prevent any doomsday scenarios, but I really haven't come to terms with what the doomsday scenario for climate change is.

I could imagine a worst case scenario that in maybe 100-1,000 years climate change has gotten so bad that islands become absorbed by the ocean, or that coastal cities are flooded and the landscape of the world as we know it is forever changed. 

If this scenario occurred I would imagine that potentially millions of people would die or be misplaced, which would be a massive tragedy, but even then, I can't imagine how it would be an existential threat to humanity.

I would assume that humans would adapt and find somewhere on the planet to survive and continue to advance humanity.. Would we not?

To me, that seems like the worst case scenario, which would not be a threat to the existence of our planet or human race, and is still a rather far-off or maybe even far-fetched scenario.

I'm not denying that climate change is real or that it may have massive consequences, but when people describe it as an existential threat, it makes me think that I'm either misunderstanding something or that it's being massively overhyped.",climatechange
Fear,"Climate Change is something that terrifies me unlike anything that I’ve feared before. When I was younger I feared the dark, slept with a nightlight...it was a blue light. I felt so grown up when I finally was able to turn it off and sleep in the dark. Then I was scared of thunderstorms and how loud they were. I felt so grown up when I could not only see they were harmless (to me being inside a house and all) but that I could fall asleep to them at night. Then I was scared of spiders. One jumped on my shirt and stared at my right in the eyes. They were alien to me. Again, I felt so grown up when I realized they only wanted bugs, not people. And again I could finally feel grown up when I could catch a spider and let it outside without any fear. Then I was afraid of nuclear war. (Quite the jump I know) I kept seeing news about Russia and North Korea that had me frightened about the possibility. I had dreams of mushroom clouds and my family screaming. I will never not be afraid of that. Sometimes when things get too quiet, I get a bit anxious as if I’m expecting a nuke to go off. I don’t think I’ll never not fear that. Then came climate change. Always knew it was happening, never denied it. The IPCC report in October had me on edge but I believed we could do it. I took an ecology class, learned how we could kill the Earth 6 ways from Sunday. I had a couple panic attacks every week for about a month. I feared for my family once again. But it was a different fear because when I looked outside all I was were the trees starting to bloom, the grass swaying in the wind. Everything seemed fine. I guess it was my first taste of what you would call Mortal Fear. The trouble I’m having with this fear is the justification. Its not like a Nuke, its not sudden or a single event. We’ve been harming the Earth for over 200 years and she can only do the same to us in return. Whenever I read about the effects I try to tell myself it won’t be a wave of heat that will turn everything into desert: its a slower, gradual process. And I think thats why my fear is worse than before. Because I’m seeing the beauty that is today and what we will loose should we do nothing. Then I read about the recent happenings in the arctic. Still cant think about it for more than a minute without panicking. Not used to it yet. I try to tell myself even if we do everything right the consequences will still hit us and we deserve it, so just roll with the punches and keep your family safe.

Climate is a self-regulating system,"No one doubts that the level of carbon dioxide has increased since the 19th century or that this leads to increased global average temperature, measurements and observations in ice and sea sediments show this. But measurements also show that there are natural fluctuations of more than 100 ppm and that nature and the atmosphere is a self-regulating system. The ice sheet builds up at Ice Age and when the temperature rises, the melting ice cools down the increasingly heated seas and works a bit like a thermostat in an ordinary car. Ocean currents change the direction because of temperature changes and if the North Atlantic Current of the Gulf Stream were to end, there would be several degrees colder in the Nordic and British islands, which would counteract the melting of the Arctic ice.

Increased temperature in the oceans leads to stronger low pressure with increased cloudiness and stronger winds. The cloud formation shields the earth from the sun radiation, which inhibits the warming. And the winds bring up dust in the atmosphere, which also filters away energy from inhalation. Along with smoke from the increased number of forest fires from areas with prolonged drought.

There are many self-regulating mechanisms like these. But the deeper and more extensive low pressures will also lead to destruction and flooding. While forests and settlements will be burned down in the hinterland and in high-altitude terrain, floods on rivers and coasts will drowning crops and settlements and destroy drinking water resources. And then the darkness comes. The clouds and dust shield of the earth may after a long cooling process end up with a new Ice Age. Which would be needed as the ice since the mid of the 19th century has melted at an ever increasing rate. And inland ice is not only temperature regulating but a vital freshwater resource.

The current level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere corresponds to a global temperature rise of about 15 degrees Celsius. But this will not mean that we will avoid cold winters and get tropical summers with warm, comfortable nights. Rather, on the contrary, the energy supplement would largely consist of different forms of destructive kinetic energy. In the end, the temperatures will fall and the winds will slow down and eventually the shielding cloud and dust layers will dissolve and the sunshine will once again reach the earth's surface. And a new, more stable climate era starts with new ice resources.

To rationalize the hypothesis like everybody seems to do, we have a cause in rising CO2, and the effect is an increase in extreme weather events, ocean acidification, forest fires and droughts... etc... the usual doom and gloom.... he then went on a I would say literal 21mins argument against the IPCC report and all the scientific wrong problems that he has found in the reports... I ended the debate with a you can believe and do what you wish as will I, but the fact is CO2 concentration is rising and we are getting environmental events that we can’t explain because of this... am I wrong?

Climate change in Romania,"[The first large tornado in Romania (video in link)](https://www.g4media.ro/video-tornada-in-judetul-calarasi-un-autocar-cu-40-de-persoane-la-bord-a-fost-aruncat-de-pe-sosea-7-oameni-fiind-raniti-zece-case-au-ramas-fara-acoperisuri.html)

Is a focus on carbon emissions an oversimplification?,"To start with, I'll just let you guys know I'm writing from the perspective of the UK, so my experience of climate change discourse is very much based on discussions happening here. 

Now to my question. This morning I was listening to the radio and the news bulletin said government advisors were claiming we need to switch entirely to electric cars by 2030. The bulletin ended, however, by saying that it was uncertain whether or not enough cobalt could be mined to achieve this goal. 

I've been thinking about this a lot recently. Climate change discourse (in the UK at least) seems very much focused on carbon emissions and getting carbon neutral, to the extent that technological solutions still seem to be the norm in this discourse. I'm talking electric cars, wind turbines, solar panels, etc. Although I advocate all of these methods of renewable energy, are we just going to be swapping one crisis for another? 

I'll explain further. What I mean is, if the UK was to switch to electric cars by 2030, would the intensive mining of cobalt in other countries (I assume you can't mine cobalt in the UK) mean we'll simply be promoting the emission of carbon elsewhere? So even though the UK will be able to say it's carbon neutral (in terms of transport at least), it will basically have offset that by causing more emissions elsewhere.

By swapping the crisis I also mean we'll be swapping a greenhouse gases crisis for a resource crisis. Surely the mining of all these resources will have a huge impact on the landscape and habitats. Furthermore, resources aren't unlimited. 

So my question, essentially, is: is focusing only on carbon emissions and getting carbon neutral an oversimplification of the issue in an attempt to make it easier to sell and understand? Don't get me wrong, I 100% back reducing carbon emissions and going carbon neutral, but I can't help but feel the consequences of this process haven't been considered fully. It seems that, as with the majority of the climate change debate, the vastness of this crisis isn't fully being comprehended and instead simple and quick fixes are being attempted. 

Totally willing to have my mind changed though! In fact, I'd rather someone did change it because my view is a bit depressing/complicated/it makes my brain hurt.",climatechange

When will the world end due to the effect of global climate change?,"As we all know, climate change is affecting our Earth tremendously, mostly because of humans, but also a bit naturally. Anyway, I’ve seen many articles saying that world will end if we don’t change something about our habits of using things that emit greenhouse gases. This scares me, but the thing is, I don’t fully buy it. Every story is different.

One article said that the world will end in 20 years. Another said 50. AOC said 12. A different article says it’s bogus. What should I believe? I need a reliable article to use and you guys are the people who I would expect to know.

What are your guys’ thoughts on this. IMO, I’ve heard the “world will end because of climate change” thing before and people have been saying it for a long time, and if those claims were true, the world would’ve ended a couple years ago.

Honest skeptic here looking for answers.,"Hi, I’m what some consider to be a “lukewarmer”, or climate agnostic. (Criteria I use: I tend to think the science is strongest for an RCP range of 3-6 not 8.5, and ECS range of 2-4) 

Unfortunately I’ve found that challenging *any* report (whether scientific, science-y, ideological media, or Hollywood movie star) on climate catastrophe, I’m often shouted down as a “denier”. 

I honestly,politely and in an open minded way, seek for answers to the truth that lies between “global warming is a hoax” and “humankind on earth has 12 years to go before certain apocalypse”

For what it’s worth, I do believe that man plays a significant role in global warming and individuals and governments need to act.

I want to do more. What can I do?,"I personally believe that the only solution to climate change is massive institutional change on a governmental level. If the governments of the world act as if this is the dire situation that it really is, we can mitigate the damage before it’s too late. We need to hold our politicians and governments accountable, and we all need to do a lot more to force change in the US (I single out the US because I’m American). I read about mass protests and student walk outs in Europe, and I wonder why this isn’t happening in the US.

I know it’s important that we all do our part, plant trees, recycle, etc.  but the little things that we can do on a daily basis are not enough. It makes me sick that people are not rising up and demanding action now...  but sadly, I am also one of those who is talking the talk but not walking the walk.

I’m an American living in Asia. I have a life here, and I don’t know when I’ll be coming back to the US to live. I’m not really in a position to be organizing protests in the country that I live in... and I live in a big city where I can’t plant trees. We all have daily lives, and sometimes it’s often not practical for us to do the things we’d like to do. Like it’s not practical for me to move back to the US just so I can protest about climate change. 

So what can I do from abroad? I’m more than happy to protest when I’m back in the states to visit. But besides that? What can I do? Are there good charities I could donate to that might actually make a difference? Are there organizations I can join where I can put some time and money in to help? Is there anything else that I can do to help that I might just not be thinking of? Should I write my congressman or congresswoman? Would that do any good, especially since my US residency is in an already very liberal place?

Electric Arc carbon sequestration via renewable sorces?

I imagine that this could be hooked up to wind turbines and other renewables to create carbon capture stations. I wonder how large something like this could be scaled up. Carbon separation from CO2 is much more effective under exposure to UV light so I'd be curious to know if the chamber which contains the  electrical arc could be exposed to sunlight somehow (bubble of transparent material that doesn't impede UV, possibly glass?) if carbon sequestration yield could be increased? (https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2003/03/030320073502.htm)

The thing about electricity is that even after arcing, it still exists and needs to ground. In theory this system could simply be a relay on a path to utilization of the same electricity for consumer purposes.

EDIT: Nevermind, it’s because light enters a uv radiation (short-wave radiation) and leaves as infrared radiation (long-wave) after it has struck earths surface.

Sure, some places might fare better, but overall the new weather will (and to some extent already is) be more chaotic and hard to deal with.

However, generally speaking, humans have been fairly good at dealing with extreme weather events, and that was dozens of thousands of years ago.

That is to say, if your aim is fame and fortune (either in cash or in nr of citations), your best bet in the current economic climate is hardly going to be weather resistant crops, material science focused on wind/rain/snow/heat resistant fabrics, efficient agriculture, Terraforming, tunneling ... etc (i.e important in dealing with the consequences of climate change).

&amp;#x200B;

So, assuming that emissions do cause huge irreversible damage to our climate in the next 20 years (as in, the kind that threatens to disrupt people's lives to the extent that they'd be willing to put their capital behind stopping it), those fields of engineering would surely flourish.

&amp;#x200B;

And, in the long run, two of humanities most pressing problem at the moment are:

&amp;#x200B;

* Building habitable environments on nearby celestial bodies other than earth
* Changing the weather patterns in sub-Sharan Africa in such a way as to make Agriculture (which requires predictive weather patterns) easy, thus hopefully ending most of the death and suffering in that part of the world.

Only issue being... neither of those are being pursued by many driven people at the moment, due to the aforementioned lacking of our economic climate. Nor would they be, if climate change ramped up, but the technologies required would advance pretty quickly.

So, would I be wrong in adopting a view that climate change might actually help press humanity into more actively investing into niches that will be useful to us in the next hundreds of years, rather than wasting away our brightest on menial problems (e.g. trading, ads, insurance... etc) ? 

The one element that I feel is missing around the discussion about consequence is the actual opportunity extreme climate change might bring for restructuring our global economy into something with somewhat more interesting aims. Not to mention, it would surely make some fairly smart put complacent people jump into action to help, since many people are somewhat lethargic unless they are dealing with a real threat.

The best equivalent I can give for this, is how large wars usually manage to actually give us dozens of years of technological progress compressed in 5-7 years of join collaborative applied research. Though, hopefully, climate change (if well handled) wouldn't bring about the same waste of human lives as a war.",climatechange

Declines in wakame and kombu seaweed harvests in Japan this season due to higher ocean temperatures and recent typhoons,"Below is my English transcription of the Youtube video and news article:

Seaweeds such as wakame and kombu, common on our dinner tables, are suffering poor harvests these days. In an average year, it would be wakame season right now. When we interviewed in the production region, the situation was serious.

Atami in Shizuoka Prefecture is known as a hot spring resort town. It is said that wakame from here is soft and tastes good. Announcer Maya Kino also helped a little for this year's first natural wakame harvesting trip. The wakame was unusually small this year. In fact, harvesting restrictions were lifted at the end of last month, but because of their small size, the start of the harvesting season was delayed until the 9th. In even more serious shape was the farmed wakame that was harvested during the winter - just one fifth of a normal year's harvest. The impact of all this in Atami is serious. In Atami, the ""Wakame Festival"" is held every year, where you can have all-you-can-eat fresh wakame, wakame miso soup and wakame salad. Since wakame has been growing slowly this year, the festival has been delayed by one month. One restaurant that had been serving wakame shabu-shabu in their regular menu decided to serve it in their secret menu instead. Bad seaweed harvests have been occurring not only in Atami but all over Japan as well.

Wakame in Iwate and Miyagi prefectures is well known as ""Sanriku wakame"", but its production level at the end of last month is 30% lower than during the same period last year. The wholesale price is now higher than even during the immediate aftermath of the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami, when it was scarce. Kombu, which is indispensable to tsukudani and dashi, continues to be in a tough spot. About 90% of Japanese kombu are from Hokkaido, and although the prices set by producers' groups depend on various factors, they have been generally rising for the last three years. Furthermore, in Okinawa, early harvest mozuku have not been growing well, and the wholesale value is higher than last year. When we asked multiple producers' groups about what is causing the bad harvests, they pointed out that seaweed cannot move around like fish. In recent years, sea temperatures have risen, and typhoons hit many areas last year. Since the seaweed itself cannot move to avoid typhoons, they can easily get washed away. In other words, the harshening environment afflicting Japan's oceans is said to be the cause of the poor seaweed harvests.

"Where will people logically migrate in Ontario, Canada due to climate change?","I am gathering information for a fictional story where the characters will need to relocate due to climate change.

Story setting: Ontario, Canada, but other provinces may be involved.

From my current research, it appears more people would move from the West (due to wildfires) to the East (lower temperatures). However, the Great Lakes appear to be heating up faster than the rest of the US. This will be more extreme weather to the Southern Ontario region. There has already been increased flooding in Ontario over the past few years.

My question is, what would be the most logical place for people to migrate? Would people in Southern Ontario migrate northeast to avoid flooding, or would people in the North be more inclined to migrate South?

I've tried looking up flooding areas and topographical maps, but my research has fallen short.

While I fully understand in reality this would most likely be a slow migration over a number of years, I intend to use artistic license to speed up the process and increase the stakes. My main concern is to get the facts correct and try to accurately predict where the characters would most likely need to go.

How long would extreme weather carry on? Would there be a mini ice age? Would the sudden loss of carbon from the air do anything weird?

Chandler wobble effects on climate,"So for those not familiar, the Chandler wobble is a name for the perturbation in the nutation of the Earth about its principal axis. This is a generally well-understood phenomena, however, there have been recent variations in the Chandler wobble of the Earth,  more recently with a 180 degree phase shift in 2005. I have posted here before asking for any knowledgeable person(s) to please cite any references to astronomical effects that could be a source of climate change. According to Gross et al, ""Some scientists predict the last wobble to have happened nearly 4000 to 7500  years ago during a time when there were dramatic changes in the pattern of monsoons across northern Africa. The researchers claim that it has  transformed the Great Saharan Desert into somewhat greener territory.""

&amp;#x200B;

Is anyone here familiar with these effects? The fact that they are still very much a topic of investigation and an open area of research, could this not be changing the atmosphere in a significant way?

Climate Scepticism Unpacked - Help!,"Dear Reddit,

There is a figure out there, that I read in an article. It is that human emissions of GHGs is only 4%. The text did not clarify if this was annual or not. I asked my professors (I am in college) about this fact, and many were not sure about this statistic - arguing that although it may be true, tipping points in systems is the main concern of climate scientists. That is that a small shift in GHG emissions can possibly trigger large unpredictable positive feedbacks that my lead to much greater and greater GHG emissions.

The numbers are respectively 633 and 704 ppm CO2, which means the path we're on is a little over RCP 4,5.

"Questions, What-ifs, And what is policy?","Global Warming.

At some point the icecaps will melt, the oceans will acidify, and the spreading desert will claim all of the eco-systems on earth. To this effect many recent debates have centered on the idea of Carbon Sequestration, removing ton after ton of carbon dioxide from our atmosphere; essentially undoing the damage done.

A recent article caught my eye. At 415 PPM Co2, these levels have not been seen for ~3 million years. But at that point in time there was, in fact, a natural amount of that element in the air.

So in out what-if scenario, if instead we were talking about ""Global Cooling"" - impending ice ages, ocean icecube events, catastrophic glacial formations destroying every eco-system on earth.... What would the policy be?

And the question; aside from anthropological generation, the effects of which are turning out to be quite impactful, if the natural swing of Earth's  climate were to trend toward and unstable or unlivable balance, is it truly appropriate for Humanity to be engaging in geo-engineering?

If we go too far in sequestering Co2 and potentially other greenhouse gasses at what point would it be decided ""alright this is stable. we are good with these conditions.""?

What I'm doing to reduce my carbon footprint.,"Hello all!

It's difficult to stay positive sometimes and wonder what us individuals can do to fight climate change, so I wanted to outline what I'm personally doing to reduce my carbon footprint. I've altered aspects of my life in the past year, and while on a large scale it isn't much, it makes me proud of what it is that I can control.

&amp;#x200B;

**ELECTRICITY**

* Starting April 1st, I will get 100% of my home electricity from renewable resources. I pay extra for this through my energy provider in California, and don't mind how it will marginally increase the cost of my bill compared to the 40% renewables on the grid (in SF). I'm from BC, Canada which is 97% renewable, and wanted to get back to that.
* Using smart home tech I have significantly reduced my energy usage through automation. Lights, fans, and other devices now auto-power off if I'm not in the room or leave my apartment. My energy bill is now just \~$25 per month down from around $38 (34.2% decrease).

&amp;#x200B;

**SOLAR**

* Prior to having the option to acquire 100% renewables for my energy bill, I experimented with solar panels.
* I capture and store, through a 21W solar panel in my apartment window, enough energy to power my phone, headphones, and other wireless devices each day. The setup was simple, and it's a nice thought each day that your phone is effectively solar-powered.

&amp;#x200B;

**GAS**

* After moving to SF I realized the heating in my place is primarily gas. Coming from Canada, I decided I would not need heating (or could warm up in other ways) and had my gas shut-off about 8 months ago. This saves about $15/mo alone on the pilot light, and reduces the constant burn of natural gas.
* For the past 6 years I have rarely used my car, only driving about 1-3 times per month. A year ago I put my car in storage and save about $200/mo on insurance. I walk to work, grocery store, or wherever I want and don't drive. If needed, I take an Uber maybe 1-2 times per month on a short trip and otherwise use local transit (electric).

&amp;#x200B;

**FOOD**

* I've rarely eaten red meat for the last 10 years anyway (due to preference), so I primarily consume chicken or soy-based proteins.
* I'm not overweight, and am very good at estimating my calorie consumption to avoid any food waste.
* A portion of my nutrients (typically breakfast) comes from Soylent (powder) and is more sustainable with less waste.
* I purposefully avoid eating at restaurants or establishments that have higher food portions (which I cannot finish) regardless if I like the food. Otherwise, see if I can split it into two meals.

&amp;#x200B;

**PLASTIC**

* As a consumer, given the choice I will purchase a product in more sustainable packaging even if it's a higher cost. I look for paper, glass, or recycled components in the packaging when possible. This doesn't take much time at all.
* Every piece of plastic I do consume I properly recycle, and when necessary ensure it's been cleaned without residue so it can be recycled.
* Plastic bags are avoided. I will carry items, use reuseable or paper-based bags instead. This is fairly easy as they are banned in SF in many cases.
* I avoid plastic lids + straws with drinks. Most of the time I only order water anyways, but will opt-out of these.
* If getting an item to-go, I will hand back any plastic utensils or other items not needed.

&amp;#x200B;

**AS A CONSUMER**

* I try to live a more minimalistic lifestyle, and aren't a big fan of 'trinkets' or useless items. I only buy what I need, and what I know I will use. I'm not an impulse-buyer, and don't end up with a lot of junk to begin with. 
* I resell or donate any items I can that I do not need. I will avoid throwing anything out if someone else can use it.
* In my job I promote less waste and make decisions that support this. In Marketing, traditionally there can be a lot of waste whether paper or useless promotional items, and I steer the team and company away from this.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I'm doing a lot already, but also that I'm just getting started. I'm working on possibly carbon-offsetting any remaining emissions I produce, and also investing in primarily green companies that are fighting against climate change.

What can I do to help.,"I’m not really sure if this is the right place to ask and if not please let me know and I shall remove but I need advice on what I can do personally to raise awareness of climate change. I’m 16 years old and I’ve always been passionate of keeping our earth a home, ever since I was a child I knew how important and special life is, how special our place in the universe is and now that I’m old enough to try and help our home I feel like I should be doing more than I currently am (which is nothing). A bit of personal information that may help me

* I have quite a following on all social media platforms that I hope I could use to raise awareness. 
* I live in then United Kingdom, Scotland to be more precise. 
* I’m not really in a place to help anything out financially but would still like to help anyway I can. 

Again I apologise if this is not the correct place to post and if asked I will remove the post. Thanks in advance for any advice!

Trajectory toward Blue Ocean Event (Arctic sea ice minimum &lt; 1 km3),"The best current estimates are that this will occur between 2030-2050.

Here's the trend line of Arctic Sea Ice Volume over the last 40 years. We are clearly in a phase of steady decline with year to year variability due to weather. Sea ice minimum has steadily declined from 17M km3 to 5M km3 during that interval.

[http://psc.apl.uw.edu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/schweiger/ice\_volume/BPIOMASIceVolumeAprSepCurrent.png](http://psc.apl.uw.edu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/schweiger/ice_volume/BPIOMASIceVolumeAprSepCurrent.png)

&amp;#x200B;

A Blue Ocean event is more than just symbolic. A lot of energy is necessary to convert ice from solid to liquid state. When the ice is gone, all of that energy will be used to heat the ocean. In addition, the lost albedo (we've already lost a lot) will alsomean greater heat absorption. This represents a significant phase change in the earth's climate system.

&amp;#x200B;

If you examine the trend line in the graph, the case for a Blue Ocean event in the suggested time line is pretty evident. Deniers will point to extremists like MacPherson making past predictions of accelerated demise of Arctic ice as a means of detracting from mainstream science projections. They're making a spurious argument.

Bison and climate change,"I recall seeing this some years ago but forgot about it until it was re-posted on FB recently:

[https://www.facebook.com/conservativestoday/photos/a.1054053151281932/2319547974732437/?type=3&amp;theater](https://www.facebook.com/conservativestoday/photos/a.1054053151281932/2319547974732437/?type=3&amp;theater)

I thought I'd put a post here for anyone else that runs into it.

The numbers in the meme all come from a single [2010 paper by Kelliher and Clark](https://sci-hub.tw/10.1016/j.agrformet.2009.11.019?fbclid=IwAR2_4hFedXzw4uetyFO12EQDHdpC0HFzattxD7YmDOSTuDj3Z76-dL_QzK8). The meme, however, grossly misrepresents the paper.

First, the meme starts by claiming that there were ""60 million buffalo"" in the US. However, this number appears specifically so the authors can dismiss it because ""The population estimate was proposed without explanation"", and then go on to state that ""bison herd population estimates from the popular literature as greatly overstated"". Then then explain why they choose 30M, half the figure stated in the meme.

Then the meme claims there are ""9.4 million dairy and 31.7 million beef cows in America"". That number also  appears in the original paper. However, it is preceded by the important statement that it includes only the cattle ""in the 10 American states occupying the bison’s historic range"". This is not the number of cattle in the US, it's the number of cattle in the great plains. If one simply googles ""number of cattle in the usa"" you'll find the total is actually around 95 million.

They make the rhetorical argument that one has to ""...prove cow fats are more destructive the the environment..."". Of course the paper also demonstrates this as well, calculating that the average modern cow releases 19% more CH4 than historical bison. The meme concludes by dismissing the whole thing, but as the paper notes, ""Thus, the Great Plains bison were estimated to have made a significant contribution to enteric CH4 emissions in the pre-industrial world.""

To put this in a global perspective, there are currently about [170 million buffalo in the world](http://www.mjas.ukim.edu.mk/files/MJAS-01-02-_2011_-048-Borghese.pdf), utterly dominated by domestic water buffalo. In contrast, there are [just over 1.4 billon cows](https://www.drovers.com/article/world-cattle-inventory-ranking-countries-fao). So even in the most ridiculous overestimates of bison populations, they remain a drop in the bucket compared to the cattle numbers.

So if anyone else comes across this, point them here.",climatechange

Extract: ""The prospect of a big El Nino later this year was raised at an international conference of climate scientists in Chile earlier this month.  


They considered parallel years, such as 2014 when a near-El Nino was reached before conditions revived a year later, creating one of the three most powerful such events in the past half century.  


""There is more heat now below the surface waiting to be tapped than there was in early 2015,"" said Michael McPhaden, a senior scientist with US National Atmospheric and Oceanic Administration who attended the Chilean event.  


""If westerly wind bursts of sufficient amplitude, duration and zonal extent develop along the equator in the next couple of months, 2019-20 could be very exciting,"" he said.  
…  
""While it's not a slam dunk that El Nino is going to persist, I think that the odds have certainly increased over one to two months ago,"" Phil Klotzbach, a research scientist at Colorado State University, said. "" We've had a big build up of heat in the eastern and central Pacific.""  
…  
Cai Wenju, a senior CSIRO scientist who has published widely on the El Nino Southern Oscillation climate pattern, said the chance of El Nino returning is high.  


A return of westerlies by about June to halt the easterly tradewinds “could spark the fire and there’s a lot of fuel"", Dr Cai said.

Is investing in green energy more harmful?,"I recently got into a discussion where a person left a pretty interesting [paper](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/mrs-energy-and-sustainability/article/lessons-from-technology-development-for-energy-and-sustainability/2D40F35844FEFEC37FDC62499DDBD4DC/core-reader). The paper mostly argued that Europe's plan of decarbonization by 80% by 2050 is unrealistic. The paper went on to say that investing in green energy can actually make climate change worse. It discusses that building green energy systems will require more fossil fuels and the energy return on investment of these green systems are not high enough to support a modern society. It cites a few recent attempts that were counter productive:

&gt;The closure of all but one of the aluminium smelters that used gas-fired  electricity in the UK (because of rising electricity costs from the  green tariffs that are over and above any global background fossil fuel  energy costs) reduces our nation's carbon dioxide emissions. [62](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/mrs-energy-and-sustainability/article/lessons-from-technology-development-for-energy-and-sustainability/2D40F35844FEFEC37FDC62499DDBD4DC/core-reader#ref62)  However, the aluminium is now imported from China where it is  made with more primitive coal-based sources of energy, making the global  problem of emissions worse! While the UK prides itself in reducing  indigenous carbon dioxide emissions by 20% since 1990, the attribution  of carbon emissions by end use shows a 20% increase over the same  period.

The EPA was established in 1970 in the US and this was a needed check. Necessary regulations around industrial and consumer pollutant output was becoming recognizably destructive to our environment. Most other nations were slow to follow suit.  
  
Since the establishment of the EPA in the US, there has been very little attention given to the advancements in both extraction and consumption of Earth-bound fuels. This is a shame as many very educated and talented STEM women and men worked so hard to make this happen.   
  
Gas/diesel-powered engines provide more power, and produce less pollutants year-over-year since the EPA was established.

Please explain your suggestions! It really does help!,"Hear me out before you downvote or comment, okay? I love this subreddit and the community so far. The information that comes through and the good atmosphere that’s open to discussion is great. I’ve been doing some reading on this subreddit again, and of course, many posts are written asking what they can do to support climate change. Great. That’s a good thing. When scrolling through the comments though, while some answers are well written out and explained, some are simply just “plant trees” or “become vegan” (both of which are options I fully support and I’m not implying they’re bad). 

Not seeing the issue yet? Here I go then. 
You can’t just write the option without explaining them, can you? People are asking for help and asking for these options because they don’t know what to do. While this doesn’t mean they are uneducated on the topic of climate change, it could very well mean they are uneducated on the possible solutions to help it. 

I know a lot of people shit on being vegan for some reason (I’m not vegan myself but I do support it), whether it’s because they are meat-lovers or because they just think it’s silly, that’s definitely going to be a roadblock for a lot of people. Depending on the reputations of certain solutions, people will just avoid them due to those reputations. 

So if you’re going to comment that veganism is a good solution, then explain why! Explain the lower carbon-footprints and it’s perks and significance. If you’re going to comment that planting trees are helpful, explain why. The more information, the better educated that person could be/get and the easier it could be to convince them to make that change. 

Let me know. Does this sound wrong or weird? I get that some people don’t have the care or the time to write out a properly written response with sources/Information. I get it, nobody is forcing you to, right? Sometimes it’s better to just not post that comment.

"A way to combat climate change, if true.","So i’m not a climate change denier, and I won’t discus my political views here, so the title or more or less a formality. 

So let’s say climate change is here, and we need to solve it. The main issues are ocean life and average global temperatures rising, causing disruptive effects in the food chain and possible damage to coastal cities from melting ice caps. 
The rise in CO2 levels are not inherently bad, and typical result in an increase in plat life, growth, and increase in O2. 
So if the CO2 is not inherently an issue, but the temperatures and flooding are, why not use geoengineering to combat these two specific issues? Dissolving copious amount of iron into the ocean typically results in massive phytoplankton growth, and releasing SO2 into the stratosphere reflects more light back out into outer space, cooling the earth. 
This is cheaper than most, if not all, proposed solutions, and could be done in just a couple decades. Time wouldn’t matter as much here, as we are reversing the effects straight away.

What do you guys think of David Wallace-Wells?,"He's been making waves somewhat recently with his book ""The Uninhabitable Earth"".  I haven't had a chance to read the full text yet, but based off the sample so far and his interviews, I'm not sure how I feel?  On the one hand I feel like he sometimes has a very practical approach -- serious while also presently potential solutions and goals for working towards a better future -- but sometimes listening to him talk I feel like he's also someone who is believes in deep adaptation/collapse.  Anyone else have thoughts/feelings about him?

I’m now getting my PhD in marine science, which is of course closely linked to climate science (thermohaline circulatuon, the ocean as a carbon sink, etc). In between undergrad and my PhD I worked for NOAA for a year. 

People ask me all the time about my job and my thoughts on climate change. I really don’t mind answering questions from people who are genuinely curious. But I feel like most people who bring up the topic just try to attack everything I say. I explain the science, and somehow it’s still not good enough. What am I supposed to do? Here’s some examples. First, there’s a woman who was on a friends post commenting completely conspiracy-theory based ideas about CO2 and was completely wrong about the chemistry involved at that. I tried to correct it but she just told me all of my science is wrong because Newton’s laws of physics are “outdated.” What? I regularly explain the science and people can’t refute it so they just say “but it’s fake” or “the science isn’t accepted.” Even my own father thinks that climate change is fabricated and scientists are making it up so they have something to study, like we don’t have better things to do. I’m honestly so over it. Any suggestions on how to deal with these kinds of people?

What can one person REALLY do?,"But honestly, what can one person really do?  What REAL impact can one single individual make about climate change?

One person making even an extreme change in their lifestyle (such as going from meat-eating to vegan as some suggest) isn't going to make even a minute difference in the big picture. Heck even offing oneself to thus ensure making a no additional carbon footprint in one's future isn't going to make a buy the world a additional millisecond.  Even if the average adult devoted the rest of their lives to fighting climate change (by living the most carbon neutral lifestyle, spending 100% of their spare time planting trees &amp; working with climate change fighting charities) I don't' see where it would make little to no difference.

I truly doubt that a non-average person can make a difference on their own.  Would it even matter if a multi-millionaire spend all of their money buying land &amp; planting trees to offset carbon emissions?  (Seriously, someone do the calculation on this please.)

The only real way to make any effective change is with power &amp; influence.  The bulk of emissions is done by corporations.  So until those stop, climate change will continue.  Industrial emissions would need to be heavily regulated &amp; corporate culture would need to change globally from ""make money first"" to ""go green even if it costs us money &amp; is inconvenient"".  This is highly unlikely to happen, as the world's economy is based on these corporations making money.  Also, even if one major government would regulate its industry, that won't do anything to affect those in other countries (other than to give them an economic advantage).

Technology is the only other answer that I see, but that is dependent in large part on those very industries which need to be regulated.  Also, on having the right person in the right circumstances (i.e., intelligent, educated people funded to do research which probably won't make money) which in large part seems to be luck.

I'm not a climate change expert or economist, or hold any position of power or influence.  I'm just an average person struggling to get by in life (like billions of other people here on this planet), &amp; wishing that I could do something that actually would make a difference.  I'd like to help, but I just don't see anything that I do is going to make any significant difference.  It just seems futile anyway unless those with greater power than me make big changes &amp; I'm not too optimistic about that. So why shouldn't' I just live out the rest of my life the way I've been going &amp; not worry about it?  I'll be dead long before any major disaster happens &amp; its not like I could prevent it anyway.",climatechange

Rambling and some Questions,"Ok, so this will be my first Reddit post and it will be on the long side so thank you for reading. I apologize if this is seen as repetitive to other topics, but I feel like I need to ask 

I am a Freshman in College in Missouri currently studying for a degree in TV and Film. One night while scrolling through Twitter, I stumbled onto discussions about climate change. Just reading about the reality of it all was chilling, to say the least. I always new it was happening but was very ignorant about just how much. I couldn’t look away from it and could barley sleep. The more I read, the worse it got. I was getting obsessed with things that were ultimately out of my control

So, I decided to browse around and then I found the subreddit and many others like it. It was immensely helpful and put a lot of my biggest fears into a more realistic concept. It’s still frightening and the future is uncertain, but I feel much more like I am informed on the whole topic. I wanted to say thank you, it was incredibly helpful.

For my questions, I have been looking into moving up north once I get out of college and was curious if I should make a plan for the future. I love Missouri, but I’m unsure if it will be truly the best option for the future. Should I look into internships in places such as Michigan or Minneapolis to establish myself when I get out of college? I’m still a bit unsure about the process, but I’m doing my research into it.

Easiest way to shut down a climate denier?,"Short and simple please, tired of bullshit opinions from people who ignore science",climatechange
Looking for information and feedback," Global warming/climate change:  
1) Is the climate changing more rapidly than we have observed in the past 150 or so years? Seems likely.  
2) Is it caused by human intervention in the environment? It is hard to just say, ""the science"" points to yes, especially knowing first-hand, that there is an extreme amount of bias and subjectivity in drawing conclusions in any scientific study. That is precisely why we do not depend indefinitely on a single source for any cutting edge result. Additionally, there is so much liberal bias in the scientific community, how can one distinguish what is subjective fact and a completely biased interpretation of results (especially when not being an expert yourself)? There is something extremely pretentious and presumptuous in a belief such as this.   
Having said that, could the deforestation and air pollutants created by industrialization of humans be a culprit or contributor? Certainly. Has literally any scientific study thoroughly assessed the possibility this is due to one of many, many astronomical perturbations of Earth's non-nominal rotation, oblateness, not-perfectly-elliptical and variably perturbed orbit, or effects of other celestial objects (ex. the Moon, Jupiter, potentially undiscovered objects in the LaGrange points of the Earth-Sun or Earth Moon systems, etc.)? Some mention astronomical effects very briefly (the most I have found is a single sentence that immediately rules this out as a possibility), but I have a very deep suspicion that they were not very thorough investigations. So as far as I have read, these things have not been addressed, and if you have anything to say otherwise, please share. My goal is to educate myself and make my own judgement call, not to blindly accept some biased researchers' opinion.  
3) Is this a bad thing? Will there be doom and gloom as a result? Many die from cold temperatures every year. As less do, the argument is that more will die from more extreme heat or other effects of climate change. Seems debatable. Nothing I have read has convinced me of deaths from heat alone being a major issue - especially in light of the drastic reduction in cold-related deaths. Will there be ""new normal"" extremes in weather patterns? We cannot even accurately predict the weather. What makes us believe these same models can somehow be more accurate over decades? Many studies are actively debating this exact thing and the jury is still out as far as I can tell. Is this sensationalism to get more research funding? Or sensationalism to get more votes/support from constituencies? Those seems much more likely than the former.  
4) Should the US be the primary entity held responsible for changing it? I strongly believe that it is quite naive and overstates our ability, let alone to even begin to understand how to positively influence a trend in such a complex system as the global environment. I mean, we cannot even predict the weather correctly (See any major snow/storm announcement in Northern Alabama in the last 6 years as an easy, albeit anecdotal example of this).   
Additionally, how can we rule out that this is not just a ploy for self-aggrandizement for the political left? When you have industrializing nations such as China and India with orders of magnitude greater populations pumping the largest amounts of pollution into the air, this seems unreasonable to put on the US's shoulders. I believe we have come quite a long way in the last 30 to 40 years and have a very acceptable amount of environmental protection in place. At some point, you get greatly diminished returns, especially when we are not even close to the primary polluters of the world.  
5) Is this a good thing? Since we will reduce the number of people dying from extreme cold, that certainly is not bad. Will an increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere lead to any other negative effects on the environment at large? The things that I have read here say things like, ""the increase in algae will cause a massive die-off of coral reefs and other sea life"". These are complex systems that DO NOT exist in isolation. When one creature or plant thrives, others sometimes take advantage of this. How do we know that animals that thrive on algae will not proportionally grow to accommodate the new source of sustenance? Can anyone say for certain that would not be the case? My limited biology background gives me the intuition that more carbon dioxide means more fuel for plant growth, which is a good thing, if we want more plants. With all of the deforestation humanity has brought about, wouldn't more lush and plentiful plant-life be a good swing in the right direction? Also, less cold globally means less need for man-made heat, i.e. reduced power needs and therefore less carbon emissions. That is also a good thing.   
Can anyone give me any other points on this or actual scientific research (not just articles written by biased journalists that think they are scientists, etc.)?",climatechange

A massive string of climate-related disasters have hit my country over the last six months. I have started researching just how dire the climate situation is and am paralysed with dread.,"EDIT: thank you to everyone who has commented. You’ve given me perspective and some useful ideas to take action. I will be careful about over researching/ thinking critically about climate news. I am going to talk to someone about my anxiety.


I live in Australia. In the past six months alone, we have had: 

* more then a million dead fish floating in the Darling River in New South Wales.
* thousands of cattle drowned in flash-flooding in rural Queensland, leaving farmers who were crippled by the drought financially ruined and struggling to bury the bodies of their animals.
* the driest and hottest January in recorded history, 1.5 degrees above the national average. Every summer has been hotter then the last.

This is in Australia, an industrially developed country that’s rich enough to shelter the majority of its citizens from the realities of climate change. I’m just starting  to comprehend how the climate disaster has ravaged other countries.

  
I am so ashamed to admit that it took a catastrophe of these proportions to shake me out of my slumber and realise the apocalypse we’re gunning towards.

  
Over the last week, I have been doing all the research I can, and it’s slowly sinking in...

  
I found out that the biggest thing that you can do to increase your climate footprint is have kids. Having kids is something I’ve always wanted to do. I love kids. I flirt with different careers but I’ve always known I want to be a dad, a grandpa.  But how can I justify having children when adding to the population will only make their situation worse? How can I justify building a career, finding someone to love, having a family, when I can’t even guarantee that my family will survive to have children of their own? I’m grieving for children I haven’t even had yet. (I know there’s always adoption, and I wouldn’t need the kids I raise to be mine biologically, but adoption laws are really strict in Australia.) My friends have a little girl and I love her more then anything. What will her future be like? Will she have a future?

  
I want to run around screaming at everybody, “Wake up! Wake up! We can’t do this anymore! We need to stop this NOW!” I’m trying to tell my parents that we need to turn fans off, and  turn powerpoints off at the wall, and stop eating so much meat, and wasting food. I’m trying to tell them how scared I am and they tell me I’ve overreacting. I’m having anxiety attacks at work. I’m trying to work my way through existential dread on my lunchbreaks. I see my friends laughing and smiling and I try and joke with them, and sometimes I even forget for a little bit. I don’t want to tell them what I’m going through. I don’t want them to be scared like I am.

  
 And it’s so horrible because I’ve experienced anxiety before, and I’ve calmed myself down by telling myself the situation that I’m worried about might never come to pass. But I can’t do that. Because the thing I’m terrified of will happen. It’s been happening for years and it’s happening now. I should be scared. Everyone should be scared. I have to take beta blockers just to get through the day. What would happen if everyone came off their anxiety meds at once? Would there be riots in the streets? Would we stop pretending everything was business as usual? Would shit actually happen?

  
Even trying to distract myself just makes the problem worse. I drive the car to work and that puts gasses into the air. I try and play my PS4 to keep my mind off everything but that just uses more electricity and puts more carbon in the air. The computer I’m typing this on consumes electricity, and was probably assembled by a Chinese slave to boot.  I will be moving to a new city in a week’s time and that flight alone will pump a few thousand cubic metres of gasses that shouldn’t be there into the air. And I don’t even fly that much - I know people my age that fly to new countries every few months just to have something new to put on their fucking Instagram. How can I justify being alive? How can I justify all the resources I consume just by existing? How can any of us?  

Our government will not propose a remotely sustainable climate policy. Our current prime minister brings lumps of coal into parliament and shakes them around saying that we shouldn’t be scared of fossil fuels.  Our government ministers go to climate change meetings and make jokes about how rising sea levels will have people in our neighbouring, tiny island nations 'with water lapping at their ankles.’ The last prime minister to propose a carbon tax lost her job because of it. They did this to us. They don’t give a shit. And we did this to ourselves by continuing to vote them in. We do this to ourselves by pulling the wool over our eyes and continuing to live our lives as if nothing is happening when it clearly is. 

  
I’m trying to take action. I’m trying to phase red meat and dairy out of my diet. I don’t want to give in. I want to get my stuff at the farmers market,  catch the train instead of the car, go on marches, make some fucking noise. If we are going out I want to go out fighting hard. I don’t want to be one of the people  who have the power or information to change and didn’t. But is it too late? Are we too far gone to make a difference? If it’s taken this long, and this much to happen to convince me, how much longer will it take to convince the skeptics? Will it be when all the water evaporates, or we can’t even drink it because it’s so acidic? Will it be when none of us can even eat real food anymore, because there’s not enough grass to feed the livestock or water to grow the crops? Will it be when the cars start catching fire in the streets and people can’t go outside in the daytime because it’s too hot? When people start dying in the street from heatstroke? When will they see?

I miss the debate about pollution.,"When I was a kid, in the eighties, I thought we would be living in a clean world by now, because there was A LOT of talk about pollution. We discussed fossil fuels, garbage in nature and everything else. Every spring at the last day of school, the local credit union gave a feast to ten grades of elementary kids for cleaning up the beach.
Ever since climate change became the label, we’ve been stuck between for and against the science.
What about the evidence? The pollution.
If we clean up, we will know. Either way, it’s the only way. In the meanwhile, we can certainly improve in cutting down on pollution.
There is very little coverage about the ocean clean up project for example.
We totally dismiss all these local beach cleaning projects and continue arguing about who is right about the science, instead of just doing the work.
The green future will happen through innovation, it’s how we are as species, always going for the next awesome thing.

I feel that the endless debate about climate change is slowing us down.
It’s giving some people stress and not the relief we get from a clean environment.
It’s giving some people depression and anxiety, because they fear it’s too late and that we will just go on like a flock of lemmings over a cliff.

So, what are some of the coolest ideas around today, that really tackle this issue and are already happening, but could use some push to scale it up and improve the situation faster?

The end is coming - no matter how fast we try to change...," 

I have accepted that the end is near for us, it's obvious at every corner, culture, art, music, all of it is reflecting a doomed humanity, those three things have ushered in many things as somewhat of a prophecy or a resonance of the emotions/feelings we have as a whole. I live in australia, every day getting scarier than the last with storms and heat. I'm only 25, sometimes I sit outside in the incoming storms and cry, because I can feel the roar of this planets last few breaths before it collapses within itself, I love nature and everything in it, I always have. I HATE humans, we've always turned what we touch into ash, my hopes were always in saving the LIFE on this planet, but we're killing the hopes for that too. insect populations plummeting globally on average of 2.5% per year, and microbes within the oceans soil - some of if not the most resilient life forms on our planet, are dying. We will take everything with us in our demise.  
What will my future be? I never asked for any of this, none of us did.  
I'm scared, not alot of people say that, you know? but I think it's important to talk about the fact we're scared.

However, some of the predictions on the news I find questionable. Such as the “12 years until we’re doomed” meme going around some climate alarmists. I believe that this is just the minimum time when we can stop warming above 1.5 degrees Celsius, and we have a _little_ more time until things start to get chaotic. This is coming from a soon-to-be 15 year old, and I believe that some of the exaggerated claims and fear mongering in some climate news is incredibly damaging to the mental health of teens and adults. 

No, we’re not going to be cooking alive and the sidewalks start melting like we are on Venus in our lifetimes. Things WILL suck in the near future, but we can survive. It is not completely bleak, like alarmists say. Is it concerning? Absolutely. Will there be an apocalypse in the next couple decades? The world, as we know it, may severely change, and some may feel like it is the end. But it is debatable, and I believe we should attempt to work to help it, but also focus on our own lives.

How to deal with Climate Anxiety,"Having lurked on this thread, and experienced many of the issues that other members have faced i.e. a sense of doom and gloom and helplessness ib this situation, I thought I would offer some advice on how to mentally deal with this scenario.

In an age where continual growth is the aim, where 'smashing our goals', and competing against everyone is all that matters, we've lost a sense of perspective. Life has become ubfeasible.

The truth is, you alone cannot solve the world's problems. Most of us can't even solve the problems of people closest to us, let alone the lives of strangers thousands of miles away. So, let's focus on what we can control. This is where stoic philosophy comes into play.

The stoics believed that there are only two things you can control; everything else is secondary. They are:

1. Your thoughts
2. Your actions

You cannot control how hot the world is going to get. You cannot control the decline of biodiversity. You cannot stop fossil fuels burning. 

What you CAN control, is your behaviour which can ultimately affect the world in a positive way.

Your job, every single day, is to simply focus on being the best citizen you can be. Being environmentally aware. Being positive. Whether you influence those around you or not, is out of your control. So don't worry about it. 

Remember this, and you will feel better about yourself, will worry less about how others will perceive you, and without realising, your actions will have impact.",climatechange
Microbes and climate strategy,"We are 90% made of microbes. These microbes affect the way we think. Our earth is covered in a layer of microbes. In our first world countries where we cleanse our environment of microbes we become off balance.

Can reforestation absorb enough CO2 to save us?,"Hello! 

I have a question, and I was hoping someone who is more knowledgeable on the topic could help me. 

Some people say that our extensive pollution of CO2 is actually beneficial to the Earth, because ""plants eat CO2! This creates more plants and we get MORE oxygen! We should burn more fossil fuels"", and it got me to thinking about the logistics and the science behind reforestation.

&amp;#x200B;

As I see it, this is the issue with the idea that plants can save us from climate change:

Before we started burning fossil fuels and adding carbon to the natural cycle, Earth had a certain coverage of forests/green areas. Consequently, the global ecosystem was in balance. Since then, we have repurposed green areas and forests for other uses, all the while continuing to inject more carbon in the the ecosystem. Today, the carbon content in the global ecosystem is much higher than it was 200 years ago. 

So, I was thinking, suppose that plants could in fact be used to save us from climate change and to negate the average temperature increase that we are projected to have. Wouldn't this require that the global coverage of forests/green areas would have to exceed the level it was on initially? I haven't looked up what the coverage was 200 years ago, nor have I checked how much carbon can actually be absorbed in plants at a global scale, but I was wondering if this ""plants will save us"" argument is viable or not.

Reading through the comments is a bit of a shitshow with both climate alarmists and denialist’s criticizing it for disagreeing with both of them and very little actual good discussion unfortunately (but that’s the norm for YouTube it seems).

I have an interest in learning more about the role of methane feedbacks, particularly from gas hydrates. However it can be hard as a layman to make sense of a lot of the conflicting views on this topic, ranging from the seemingly more accepted view that methane hydrates will pose little threat this century, to the extreme view that methane hydrates will go off and bring about the apocalypse within our lifetimes.

Which brings me to Natalia Shakova. It seems like the more alarmist voices consider her findings to be the gold standard when it comes to this topic, and from what I can tell most of the methane alarmism that has become recently popular largely originated with her findings on the East Siberian Arctic Shelf and her concerns of a large release being feasible.

What I am wondering is what is the actual view of her and her work in the scientific community?

Is there any way to create a sustainable society that is capable of the current level of technology without dying out?,"A very, very, very loaded question. And one which probably has a very simple answer - No. But as someone who's fairly young, it really scares me to think of the future where not only do we all die out, but all of the progress we made as a society erases because it was bad for the earth. I feel ashamed for liking everything the society offers knowing it's bad for the earth, and also knowing it's a large part of the reason why we are in the position we're in. TV, Video Games, Luxuries, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is there any way we could possibly make this society sustainable, or would we all have to essentially live in the stone age era? Or is the answer more like ""We'll never know because we need a certain level of technology to find out, but we'll die out before that technology exists"". ",climatechange

"Debunking ""climate skeptics,"" part 1. There is no greenhouse gas effect.","Hi guys! I'm thinking about making a series of posts debunking various ""climate skeptic"" arguments. First, I'll say that ""climate skeptic"" is a poorly defined term, but that seems to be the self-identification a lot of these people use. These ""climate skeptics"" run the gamut from fairly reasonable people like Judith Curry to nutjobs like Anthony Heller. Maybe I'll get to him later.

So today's post is about people who don't even think there is a greenhouse effect. I've argued with several people like this in a different climate subreddit. There's even a paper by Nikolov and Zeller (2017) about it (see sources below).

There's a fun little story about these guys. So there was a paper published by Volokin and ReLlez (2014), well, it turns out that's just Nikolov and Zeller spelling their names backwards. So I guess now it's Nikolov and Zeller (2014). Anthony Watts wrote about this. In case you're not aware, Anthony Watts runs [wattsupwiththat.com](https://wattsupwiththat.com), a ""climate skeptic"" blog, so you might expect they would have a sympathetic view towards the paper. Here's what Watts had to say about it ([https://wattsupwiththat.com/2016/09/14/climate-skeptics-behaving-badly/](https://wattsupwiththat.com/2016/09/14/climate-skeptics-behaving-badly/)):

""Submitting a paper with your names reversed? I’m sorry… **This. is. just. stupid.** And I agree with Gavin, the paper itself is nonsense. Their work has been the same sort of “pressure rules the temperature of planetary atmospheres” nonsense that the irascible Doug Cotton pushes…under multiple fake names to try to get attention, here and elsewhere. Now they seem to have followed his lead.

I’ve had experience with these two people, Nikolov and Zeller before….and it has not been a good experience. There’s some behind the scenes ugliness they presented in email that I don’t plan to talk about. That’s why I don’t carry their views anymore and never will again, that’s doubly true now after this sad move with the fake names.""

Anyway, enough of the silly drama, let's look at what the papers say. So the standard view of the greenhouse effect is (Schmidt 2010):

""The global mean greenhouse effect can be defined as the difference between the planetary blackbody emitting temperature (in balance with the absorbed solar irradiance) and the global mean surface temperature. The actual mean surface temperature is larger (by around 33°C, assuming a constant planetary albedo) due to the absorption and emission of long‐wave (LW) radiation in the atmosphere by a number of different “greenhouse” substances.""

In other words, without an atmosphere, earth's temperature would be \~33 degrees Celsius cooler. So Nikolov and Zeller (2014) calculate the difference, using unconventional methods, as \~90 degrees Celsius:

""Physical evidence is presented that Earth’s ATE should be assessed against the temperature of an equivalent airless body such as the Moon rather than a hypothetical atmosphere devoid of greenhouse gases. Employing the new temperature formula we show that Earth’s *total* ATE is \~90 K, not 33 K, and that ATE = GE + TE, where GE is the thermal effect of greenhouse gases, while TE &gt; 15 K is a thermodynamic enhancement independent of the atmospheric infrared back radiation. It is concluded that the contribution of greenhouse gases to Earth’s ATE defined as GE = ATE – TE might be greater than 33 K, but will remain uncertain until the strength of the hereto identified TE is fully quantified by future research.""

So, unusual, but if true this would seem to indicate that traditional estimates of the total greenhouse effect are actually underestimates, with some (at that point) nebulous additional contribution raising the global temperature.

Nikolov and Zeller (2017) runs this even farther off the rails:

""A key entailment from the model is that the atmospheric ‘greenhouse effect’ currently viewed as a radiative phenomenon is in fact an adiabatic (pressure-induced) thermal enhancement analogous to compression heating and independent of atmospheric composition.""

According to them, planetary temperatures are only dependent on top-of-the-atmosphere solar irradiance and total surface atmospheric pressure. How'd they come to that conclusion? It's an interesting case, the paper may look convincing on the surface. Roughly, they came up with a bunch of regression models using physical parameters for various solar system bodies, found one that seemed to show that the surface temperature could be calculated using solar irradiance and atmospheric pressure, then concluded that only those two variables contribute to planetary temperature.

This blog post ([http://rabett.blogspot.com/2017/08/making-elephant-dance-as-performed-by.html](http://rabett.blogspot.com/2017/08/making-elephant-dance-as-performed-by.html)) breaks it down some more:

""So briefly, what goes on is to fit the five average surface temperatures of five plants or moons (Venus, Earth, the Moon, Mars, Titan and Triton.  Wait you say, that's six, not five, but they leave Titan out of the mix because  (Eli told you this would be yummy) to an arbitrary functional form

y = *a* exp(*b*x) + *c* exp(*d*x)

Wait you say again, ok, that is four parameters and the functional form plucked out of thin air, but what is *x* and *y.*  That's kind of interesting and more than a bit light fingered but you have to watch the moving cup.  The independent variable is a ratio of pressures *(Ps/Pr)*.  *Ps* is the pressure at the surface, *Pr*, well that's interesting, *Pr* starts out as the ""*minimum air pressure required for the existence of a liquid solvent at the surface, hereto called a reference pressure (Pr)*"" but about a page further on it morphs into

&gt;For a reference pressure, we used the gas-liquid-solid triple point of water, i.e., *Pr*=611.73Pa \[38\] defining a baric threshold, below which water can only exists in a solid/vapor phase and not in a liquid form. The results of our analysis are not sensitive to the particular choice of a reference pressure value; hence, the selection of *Pr* is a matter of convention.

The alert out there have noticed that the minimum air pressure required for the existence of a liquid solvent at the surface kind of depends on the temperature of the surface, and would vary widely from planet to planet. Of course worry bunnies like Eli might ask:  What liquid?  Water exists as water on the surface of the Earth, if there was any as steam at Venus and as ice at all the others if it exists there at all.  For Venus maybe CO2, but at the surface of Venus CO2 is a supercritical fluid and you can't tell the difference between liquid and gas.  At Titan, there are oceans, but oceans of methane, so any useful *Pr* is going to be wildly different for all of these bodies and, in the case of the Mars, and Triton some pretty fancy liquids are going to be needed.

Selection of water as the solvent of choice is then both arbitrary and unphysical.  But why do Nikolov and Zeller insist on using it? Turns out their elephantine trunk waving depends on using dimensionless variables, but restricting *Pr* to an inappropriate value independent of the planet is equivalent to stripping the units off of the surface pressure *Ps*.""

&amp;#x200B;

So, the paper is a good example of how, with enough statistics and cherry-picking, and enough variables, you can come to almost any conclusion you want. It is to be expected that you would find a correlation between atmospheric pressure and planetary temperature; planets with a denser atmosphere generally have more greenhouse gases. Of course, the paper fails to explain the TOA absorption spectrum or other evidence for the greenhouse effect ([http://geosci.uchicago.edu/\~rtp1/papers/PhysTodayRT2011.pdf](http://geosci.uchicago.edu/~rtp1/papers/PhysTodayRT2011.pdf)). Am I being too dismissive? Well, in the more rational parts of ""climate skeptic"" world, the paper was also dismissed. I usually take anything published at wattsupwiththat with a big grain of salt, but here ([https://wattsupwiththat.com/2012/01/13/a-matter-of-some-gravity/?fbclid=IwAR1Lkiqzw8bCx06u5ABMQMfevy0bweKzZfdBatFOIj0aWTAmi\_HrcKEYJDQ](https://wattsupwiththat.com/2012/01/13/a-matter-of-some-gravity/?fbclid=IwAR1Lkiqzw8bCx06u5ABMQMfevy0bweKzZfdBatFOIj0aWTAmi_HrcKEYJDQ)) Eschenbach does a decent job explaining why the hypothesis of Nikolov and Zeller violates the law of conservation of energy:

""I hold that with a transparent GHG-free atmosphere, neither the hypothetical “N&amp;Z effect” nor the “Jelbring effect” can possibly raise the planetary temperature above the theoretical S-B temperature. But I also make a much more general claim. I hold it can be proven that there is **no possible mechanism involving gravity and the atmosphere** that can raise the temperature of a planet with a transparent GHG-free atmosphere above the theoretical S-B temperature.

The proof is by contradiction. This is a proof where you assume that the theorem is right, and then show that if it is right it leads to an impossible situation, so it cannot possibly be right.

So let us assume that we have the airless perfectly evenly heated blackbody planet that I spoke of above, evenly surrounded by a sphere of mini-suns. The temperature of this theoretical planet is, of course, the theoretical S-B temperature.

Now suppose we add an atmosphere to the planet, a transparent GHG-free atmosphere. If the theories of N&amp;K and Jelbring are correct, the temperature of the planet will rise.

But when the temperature of a perfect blackbody planet rises … the surface radiation of that planet must rise as well.

And because the atmosphere is transparent, this means that **the planet is radiating to space more energy than it receives.** This is an obvious violation of conservation of energy, so any theories proposing such a warming must be incorrect.

Q.E.D.""

And some more criticism of Nikolov and Zeller from blogs (no one has bothered to publish a rebuttal in the literature):

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR? Nikolov and Zeller are wrong, models of planetary surface temperatures without the greenhouse gas effect violate the law of conservation of energy.

Couldn’t find a flaw in this conspiracy about an alternative cause of global warming,"Humans consume 10 million gigatons of water each year. 70% of that is used to water  plants in agriculture (1). The water on the fields has 3 ways to go:
 - sinking deep into lower levels of the soil 
 - evaporate 
 - being absorbed by the plants (what also eventually leads to evaporation, because plants evaporate water over the leaves)

Actually farmers try to increase field water efficiency (fraction of water used by plants to total water used) but let’s say only 10% evaporate. That means 700 000 gigatons of water evaporate each year. Most of it by Irrigation. Rivers are redirected and spread over huge agricultural areas. On that area the sun developes enough energy to evaporate the water while it would just run into  the ocean without human influence. So we are basically evaporating rivers all over the world. And that is much more efficient than digging for coal and burn it.

But what about rain? Water doesn’t stay in the atmosphere!

Yes, and that’s why many reliable sources claim human couldn’t influence water content in the atmosphere. Because it comes down again, it can’t increase, can it? Yes of course it can. The numbers of airplanes in the air is increasing even though they don’t stuck in the air. Around 16000 planes are in the air right now (2019) and this number is going to increase. Around 200000 takeoffs  every day, which means around 8000 take offs per hour. An average flight duration of 2 hours means, that when you take off, 16 000 other planes take off before you land. And if you increase the take offs per hour you will have more planes in the air, even if the average duration remains at 2 hours.
So the same thing with water. Water remains about 10 days in the atmosphere (2). As mentioned earlier, 700 000 gigatons are evaporated each year. That means 2000 gigatons per day. So within the 10 day lifetime of water 20 000 gigatons are  evaporated due to human influences. Compared to CO2 we emit 30 gigatons each year. according to the simple calculation above we increased the water content much more than we increased CO2. And that while H2O is a much more potent greenhouse gas than CO2. That would mean water vapor is the main cause of global warming!

Why can’t we measure the increase of water?

A gas needs around 1 year to reach each part of the atmosphere and even longer to be homogeneously mixed in the atmosphere. Since the lifetime of CO2 is so large, it actually is almost homogeneously mixed in the atmosphere. That means if you measure CO2 in only one spot, you know the content on alle other spots, because it’s the same.
H20 however has a short life time. The water content varies extremely in different location. When you see clouds, the water content is higher in the cloud than right next to it. You would need an infinite amount of measure spots to estimate the global water content in the atmosphere. Secondly the water content is around 2%. 2.43% or 2.44% is an increase by less than 1%. But for CO2 a difference between 0,03 and 0,04 is significant enough to be measured.

But we can’t add water to the atmosphere!

I never understood this argument. Ever hang out wet laundry? It dries in the sun. The water doesn’t disappear, it evaporates and is in the atmosphere. If the relative humidity (RH) was 100% the clothes wouldn’t dry. Sweating would be inefficient and you would have fog. At 100% RH you need to heat the air in order to take up more water. However when RH is below 100% it can take up more water. That’s the definition of RH. And as we observe in daily life, 100% RH is not common on surface altitude. That’s how sweating works, water is evaporating from the skin to cool the skin. And that’s possible without heating up the air, otherwise evolution wouldn’t have given us the ability to sweat.

Possible mistakes/errors

* most trivial would be a failed conversion between gigatons, cubic meter, kg etc.. because we are talking about millions of gigatons it’s possible. I think I did it right but maybe double check.
* error in the basic concept: maybe I overlooked something. Most likely the point why humans can’t add water to atmosphere. Many sources claim we have to heat up the air to increase water content. But I don’t understand why. I think it would be true at 100%RH but below we can ofcourse evaporate water as we observe in daily life. In Chile millions of liter of water are pumped to the surface and evaporated by the sun because in the remaining salt Lithium can be found. I think I gave enough example why I think we actually can evaporate water. The claim we can’t sounds so stupid to me, I don’t know why everyone says that.
* some more complex phenomenon is involved. Maybe water evaporated from agriculture has a different life time. A few hours would be enough though. The amount of water evaporation is so much higher than the CO2... Also i don’t see why water vapor from humans would behave different than natural vapor. We are basically just wetting the earths surface. Then the sun does the rest in natural processes.

I think it’s more likely I did a mistake and that most of other scientists are right. However I didn’t find a flaw here. Most people I explained this to blamed me as a sceptic but didn’t have any scientific argument. I’m open to discussion but I hope you are open too and can consider my thoughts scientifically and neutrally even though it’s against the consensus.
Thank you.

Show Your Strips: Warming Stripes From 1901-2018 - Asia is clearly in trouble.,"Found a great site today called [Show Your Stripes](https://showyourstripes.info/) which visualized the average yearly temperatures, by country, from 1901 to 2018.

How Can I Fight Climate Change,"Hi All,

I am young (early 30s) and have made enough money to never work again. I would like to dedicate the rest of my life to fighting climate change and thought I’d ask you where my time would be best spent. 

My skill set is business related, rather than advocacy / politics or engineering / science so I am thinking I would be most effective setting up a company with the explicit purpose of fighting climate change and pushing all excess profits back into research. Do you agree with this? If so, what business would have the most impact that is not already well served?

I’ll add that I live in the Pacific Northwest between Canada and the US.

"If the greenhouse effect is causing global warming, wouldn't building a massive multi-square kilometer mirror/a network of millions of mirrors solve all problems?","Seeing some news about solar farms actually raising local weather temperatures due to the fact the black surfaces absorb so much heat has gotten me thinking

&amp;#x200B;

If a problem is the melting ice caps leading to more ocean, the dark surface absorbing more sunlight, and other problems involving the trapping of sunlight, mirrors would reflect light directly back into space.

So if we just covered several square kilometers of ocean or unused land (deserts already reflect a lot of sunlight) with floating mirrors/polish aluminum sheets, wouldn't this solve global warming? just paving land with aluminum foil or millions of floating foil-covered objects covering square kilometers of the ocean?

Are we still heading towards a RCP 8.5 World?,"I have a decent feeling that we'll be hitting peak carbon emissions soon. The coal industry is slowly crumbling, renewables such as solar are outpacing coal and are becoming exponentially cheaper. Many countries (and even US states) are beginning to lower emissions. Even China is supposedly peaking emissions soon as it replaces it's coal production with renewables as it transfers to a service economy. 

And yet, I'm hearing it'll take ~20 years for most of the coal plants currently running to be decomissioned. France is reporting 110 F weather in a bitter heatwave. I'm hearing that even our exponential progress with reducing emissions, bit by bit, are not enough to keep us under a 3 or 4 C future.

Are we still heading towards a RCP 8.5 World? Or have we begun to veer more towards a less catastrophic 6.0 or 4.5 world? Has any real progress been made in the 11 months since the August report?",climatechange

What makes climate change now different from previous periods of climate change?,"I should start out by saying I’m in no way trying to deny human-caused climate change! I’m just curious as to whether there are differences between climate change now and previous periods of climate change. 

I recently listened to a podcast on ice ages, and it explained how the planet has been through a lot of periods of warming and cooling. It got me thinking, life on earth has survived these periods and it seems fairly natural, so what makes the current period of man-made climate change different? I think it’s easiest to just list my questions below. 

1.) There’s a lot of talk of more extreme weather events because of climate change. Was this the case during periods of climate change hundreds of millions of years ago as well? Or is it specific to climate change now? 

2.) If the planet has already been through periods of climate change, is there anything that makes this period unique? Is it faster? Are the gases in the atmosphere different? 

3.) Is the reason climate change now is so bad because it’s also coupled with other human-caused phenomena like industrial agriculture and deforestation?

A thought about climate change.,"If you spill petrol on snow it melts.. It does try it.

So what if the snow melting is not global warming but something else??..

I have an idea what else it could be..

&amp;#x200B;

Imagine the smoke from all the cars?.. When the smoke blows all over the world the rain comes down and mixes with the smoke creating rain with petrol in it??.. And when it hits the floor its like spilling petrol all over the snow?..

But way milder than petrol ..watered down petrol.. Some say acid rain??..NO not acid rain.

&amp;#x200B;

Just think if you light a fire and pour pure water over the smoke the water is not pure anymore its mixed with the smoke.

And what ever is in the smoke will be in the water in less amounts because of the water added..

&amp;#x200B;

The fact its got nothing to do with the earth heating up.. Just pure water as in rain soaking it up and putting it back on the land with snow on it..  And smoke blows all over the place ..

&amp;#x200B;

More people in Canada .. Smoke getting blew all over Canada with the rain coming down will hit the snow and melt it faster.. Like petrol in the snow but diluted petrol from the rain pouring down..

&amp;#x200B;

Green land more smoke created ..Blows over the antarctica snow fall captures the smoke with petrol in it..

They call it acid rain   BUT  they sayits because of the earth heating up when it has nothing to do with the heat ..

&amp;#x200B;

It was all to do with the smoke..   Get smoke pour PURE WATER over it and test the water ..

And we have smoke blowing everywhere .. All over the world .. 

those parts it rains or snows will fall all over the smoke and melt the ice caps ..

&amp;#x200B;

Not one of the top 10 emitter countries meet its current Paris agreement target. Even if all the countries meet its current goals, that put us to a 3C warming ( [https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/12/07/climate/world-emissions-paris-goals-not-on-track.html](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/12/07/climate/world-emissions-paris-goals-not-on-track.html) ), very much short of hitting 2C, and 1.5C is basically a pipe dream. 

&amp;#x200B;

In fact, 6 of the top 10 emitter countries, including us, are in the highly/critically insufficient categories, which basically are emitting towards 3C+/4C+. 

&amp;#x200B;

And these are the ""easy"" goals. The basic premise for the Paris agreement is that reaching the ""easy"" goals will bootstrap countries to be more ambitious. Since almost no one who matters reaches the easy goals, there is little hope (at least for me) that we are going to reach the more ambitious ones. Some may wish for some miracle carbon capture tech that saves the day. But wishing is not a strategy. There is no indication that such a tech (and the necessary scale up) is going to be available soon.

&amp;#x200B;

And i also ask myself .. why no countries step up enough. The answer is clear. Humans are basically selfish and myopic. You can blame the politicians. But look at what the voters and the public chose in Brazil, Australia and even here in the US. Even the French yellow jackets are against a carbon tax. Basically people care more about their immediate livelihood than saving the planet (i.e. don't tax me and ask me to walk to work)

&amp;#x200B;

I am sure many are going to try to move minds. Many are going to create a lot of noises. Personally i do not believe we are going to avoid 2C+, probably 3C or even more .. given all the issues about permafrost de-frosing well in advance of projection. The good news is that in a rich country like the US, as long as I do not live close to the coast (which I do not, and will not), survival is probably not a problem. There will be addition heating/cooling and maintenance costs but the US (and other first world countries) will probably be fine.  I am certainly sad about the Fiji and other less fortunate people who are going to be impacted. But like what is happening in India now, i do not believe there is anything I can do. And yes, if everyone thinks like that, we are doomed ... but that is the point. Most human thinks like that. Selfishness is in our nature. Look up the classical tragedy of the common problem. We doom ourselves.

Dangers of air pollution - another argument for climate crisis?,"I've been reading a lot of information and debates on the climate crisis lately, and furthermore been finding a lot of people simply stating that greenhouse gases aren't an issue, all the scientific evidence is faked and flawed, that this isn't due to humans, etc. I often don't know where to start with debating these. I think part of that reason is that we have a lot of arguments and information, but it may be the same thing being used over and over again. Don't get me wrong, this is crucial and undeniable information. But if someone isn't going to listen to it, I figure I should think of a new way to debate it. 

So I've been thinking about some new points to use, specifically about carbon and other GHG emissions. Here's the one I think may be pretty solid:

**Greenhouse gases and air pollution are extremely dangerous to all people living in an effected area.** 

I think about large cities in countries such as India and China. These places have so much air pollution (which is quite obviously due to the human activity) and it is very harmful to the people there.

&gt;Dangerous weather conditions such a acid rain and smog have created hazards for Indian citizens. Acid rain contains hydrogen ions, which can damage trees, crops, harm marine animals and destroy metals. Sometimes the damage that is done from acid rain can be devastating. Smog causes harmful health effects in humans and animals.  Studies have shown signs of black lung disease in dolphins of due to high concentrations of carbon particles in the air. The effects of smog can be irreversible, impacting someone's future health greatly.  
Unfortunately, aside from strange yet dangerous weather, frequent exposure to polluted air increases the risk of cardiovascular disease. This restricts many Indians from exercising, since that's when air consumption is used more rapidly.  Breathing air that is filled with small particles can increase the chance of getting hardening of the arteries, triggering cardiac arrhythmia or even having a heart attack. Statistics show that annual premature deaths caused by particulate air pollution have increased by six times since the year 2000.

(quote from the India Pollution Project)

On top of this, the Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute in India found that 2.2 million Indian children are affected by lung damage that they will carry the rest of their lives - and a UNICEF report listed that air pollution is responsible for 600,00 deaths of Indian children below the age of five every year.

This is something caused by human activity and over emissions, and it is extremely harmful. What happens as countries such as the United States continue to spew so many GHGs into the atmosphere? It will create more dangerous conditions. I know it may not get as severe as these huge cities, mostly due to the really high population densities in these specific examples, but it still goes to show how these things are harmful and detrimental to everyone.

I don't want this to be seen as me saying that other things aren't true arguments, I just feel like we should introduce new ones to people who are truly dead set on denying previous ones. Maybe this isn't even a new idea, I just haven't heard it before in the climate change debate setting. So that's my idea. Is this a good argument? Does anyone have any things to add or point out? Could this be helpful in taking down some deniers? Thanks.",climatechange

"In light of recent Greenland events, does anybody have any idea how long we've got?","I've read 2050, 2024, and doubtless a few in between that I forgot. But do we, does *science*, have any relatively reliable notion of by what year our planet's climate will become, for practical purposes, incompatible with human life?

And if possible, can it be broken down to points on the spectrum? For example, 

* Group A - the very young, the very old, and the very ill

* Group B, adults and youth who, though healthy, have spent their lives in air conditioning or temperatures below 70 (F)

* Group C healthy adults and youth who have been accustomed since birth to live, work, and study for much or all of the year in 3-digit temperatures (F)

What are your ideas for explaining the science of climate change as easily as possible?,"I was hoping we could have a discussion about easy ways to spread the science! I've noticed that the main issue I have in any climate change discussion is that I don't have enough time to properly explain the science in any way that has real impact. I was hoping /r/climatechange could help me solve this problem. If you have suggestions for other points or other ways to get across those points, I'll add them gladly! Try to be as short and impactful as possible. Here's some topics, and ideas that don't seem very effective because they're too long:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Why gases cause the climate to change:

&amp;#x200B;

(I've been told that this idea misrepesents the information by /u/deck_hand, although I personally think the cause and affect relationship is decent) We know a warm object in a cold room becomes cool, and a cold object in a warm room becomes warm. The earth is sort of like the opposite of a cooler. It keeps us warm in the absolute zero temperatures of space. The power source of this heater is the combination of gases covering the surface that trap heat emitted by the sun. Putting more of these gases into the atmosphere is the converse of putting more ice in the cooler, the planet gets more hot rather quickly.

&amp;#x200B;

From /u/Wallawallawallawa 

2. The reason this is multiplicative:

&amp;#x200B;

When you put ice in a cooler, the cooler and objects inside don't become instantly cold. No, the ice slowly heats up the surrounding air and the objects inside. Then, because it's a cooler, the ice stays frozen for a long while. Even when the ice begins to melt, the temperature doesn't reach above freezing until all of the ice has melted. Now apply that concept to the planet on a global scale. The planet slowly heats up over the course of years due to released emissions, then it will stay like heated while the gases stay trapped in our atmosphere. Whereas the ice melts in a few hours, because of the size of the planet, most of these gases won't leave our atmosphere for 100 years.

&amp;#x200B;

3. The reason it's detrimental:

&amp;#x200B;

Key points could possibly be; sea level rise, increased weather anomalies/anomaly severity with decreased predictability, why the small change in temperature has enough impact to kill off hundreds of species.

&amp;#x200B;

From /u/Wallawallawallawa:  We are currently on track for warming of close to 4 degrees Celsius by 2100. Temperatures have changed in the past too. The last 200 thousand years or so, we can clearly distinguish 6 ice ages. The last ice age resulted in a build up of a huge glacier across Northern US and Northern Europe. New York was buried under 1 km of ice. The ice reached higher than the skyscrapers do today. The global temperature difference then with respect to today: 4 degrees Celsius 

&amp;#x200B;

From /u/Macralicious:  A warming climate produces more extreme weather events, and this has a detrimental impact on our ability to grow food. Right now for example, huge swathes of farmland in the US are waterlogged and this season's crops are therefore in danger of failing. In the UK, the average size of potatoes was down, and in Italy they lost about 59% of their olive yield. They sound like ""cute"" stories, but both were attributed to more frequent extreme weather affecting the growth of the crops. If the anomalous weather becomes too frequent, the serious issue is obvious. This also affects wild animals, whose food sources will be disrupted.

&amp;#x200B;

~~4. Why we don't see the affects in a lot of the first world:~~

4. How different areas see different affects:

&amp;#x200B;

Should talk about the atmospheric system and how heat is distributed out around the planet from the equator, thus equatorial countries take the brunt. Could possibly bring up the increased rate of expansion of the Sahara. The changes then occurred over approx 10000 years. We're achieving the same increase in as little as 100 years.  

&amp;#x200B;

From /u/Macralicious:  The California wildfires, extreme cold across the Midwest last winter, all of the aforementioned crop growing issues. The reason we don't notice as much (in my opinion) is that most of the first world has relatively mild climates to begin with; the impacts of climate change are felt more in Africa for example because they were closer to the boundary of what's habitable in the first place. They also have lesser resources and infrastructure that would enable them to be robust against, and cope with, the anomalies.

&amp;#x200B;

5. How do we deal with complete discreditors?

&amp;#x200B;

From /u/Wallawallawallawa: Of course there is lobbying of green groups, but that doesn't mean they're wrong. And wouldn't you expect there to be more lobbying by powerful oil interests?""  Exxon instead buried this knowledge and ferociously lobbied against the it. All of this was uncovered by pulitzer prize nominated research journalism.

Genuine Question: 2hy arent the sea levels rising more?,"I obviously know climate change is a serious issue, just trying to understand something. 

You see before and after pictures of the ice caps from like 1970 to now and a massive amount has melted off. Yet the sea level hasn't risen. Yeah, maybe it's risen like 2 inches but all this hysteria of half of America going underwater seems like bullshit. Can someone explain the science as to why the sea levels aren't rising? Or am I just blind and they actually have risen the amount we'd  expect? I'm assuming I'm wrong.",climatechange
Crazy question: Are there any study done on the viability of using an orbital elevator as giant water pump ?,"And the viability of even building one ?
So that we could extract melting ice cap on the pole and use them for, i don't know, trying to kickstart terraforming Mars or something ?  

Since a lot of mad businessmen are more bothered about emigrating to Mars or creating robot overlord (ok, i'm half trolling here). Seriously though, is there any mad scientist actually researching that ?

Since i'm done believing in people managing to vote for some guy in every country that would do something about CO2, any dictator deciding they should think about their grand children... there ain't much more that can be done in time to avoid rising sea. Climate change might be more survivable without 300m rise in the sea level in the next 2 century. And honestly, except for ""magicaly"" making the problem diseapear, i don't see that not happening. And since magic is science, except for a giant orbital water pump, what else is out there ?

Study - Air temperature changes in the arctic from 1801 to 1920 -,"Link to the study:

https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/joc.1918

This is an overlooked study that comes to very different conclusions about past arctic temperatures than do proxy studies. 

Some key points:

 - ""On average, the Arctic as a whole was colder by 0.8C"" 

(Which is exactly the global rise reported today) 

 - ""Annual mean temperatures in all the 20-year periods and in all climatic regions were colder than today .... Differences generally are less  than  2C""

 - ""significantly colder autumns were observed in the period 1801 – 1860 in comparison with the
period 1861 – 1920."" 

(That lines up perfectly with LIA conditions)

 - ""The  greatest  discrepancies between the real Arctic and the Subarctic occurred in spring. The former was only a little colder than it is at present (by 0.2C), whereas the latter experienced quite significant cooling (by 1.1C)""

(That shows very little change near the pole and greater change in the sub-arctic. So, the spring melt was slower in most years than we see today}

 - ""... Canadian and Baffin Bay regions, where, on average, April was warmer than today by 0.3C. On the other hand, negative differences (−0.3C, i.e. colder conditions than present) were observed in the Atlantic
and Pacific regions.""

(This implies that there is far more regional variability in arctic temperature conditions than is generally noted)

 - ""The results show that air temperatures in the Arctic from 1801 to 1920 were not as exceptionally cold as has been suggested by some analyses of proxy data""

(So, modern reports of a major increase in arctic temperatures are likely exaggerated.)

 - ""Throughout the whole study period, the majority of mean monthly temperatures lie within one [SD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation) from the modern mean.""

(Which means that about 80% of the measurements are within a normal range of temperature variability)

Most significant is the conclusion that the period 1800-60 was colder in all arctic regions than the period 1861-1920. That means that warming was already occurring in the arctic and sub-arctic well before any warming could be attributed to human causes.",climatechange

Climate change in Vietnam,"Hi, as South East Asia is ""deemed"" one of the most affected regions due to the upbringing of climate change recently, my school assigned me to do a project on Climate change adaptation in Vietnam and its affection on the Agriculture due to me being a Vietnamese. So I did some research on this and I want to ask the professionals to evaluate and maybe add to my research on this topic. Thank you. 

 

The downstream of the Mekong River in Vietnam conclude the largest areas to be severely affected by the consequences of ecological crisis. A national institute reported that salt-water intrusion had influenced many areas near Mekong River, the salt-water reached into about 70km mainland with an intensity of around 13-30%. Due to the low surface elevation level, high population density, and high dependencies of agriculture and aquaculture, it would have a severe impact on citizen lives and economics. A study shows that by 2100, sea level would rise by one meter, following that is 10% of the population is affected and an estimated 10% loss on the country GDP (Tran Duc, 2019).

In Ben Tre, a province-owned hydro station has measured to a significant rise of 25cm in sea level and drops in fresh rive outflows. At the same time, 4% salinity was recorded in the Co Chien River from 45-52 km inland in April 2013. The expectation for the 4% salinity up-river would have reached 40km in-land by 2040. This put Ben Tre in an unfavorable condition; it’s a province surrounded water, yet it’s inhabitable due to the lack of fresh water to sustain agricultural growth and human consumption (DANIDA, 2013).

Thua Thien Hue is in a critical state of a possible major natural disaster happening within the impact of climate change in recent years. Its terrain varies significantly from the mountain with a peak elevation of 500-1000m down to the plain with a mere 20m above sea level and the sea on the opposite side. As a result, the province only consists of 54% mainland with a tilt of over 25°; the rest is the oceans. Due to this topography, it is essentially creating a periodically consistent main flood which is separated into 4 main types of floods. Winter floods, Late floods, Early floods, and Summer floods. Collected data shows that major surges occur mostly during winter. (Shaw, 2006).

(Ir)rational fear of excessive resource use,"In parallel with the increasing amounts of GHGs that enter our atmosphere, we are also facing the risk of resource scarcity. This is because we (humans) are exploiting our planet's resources unsustainably. Recently, I've begun to be more considerate of this, and I try to limit myself in how much I ""consume"" on a daily basis. There are many aspects that can be discussed in this regard, but today I would like to focus on excessive water use.

I have lived in regions where water has been scarce, and I have learned to appreciate water more. For instance, I keep my showers short, I seldom use an electronic dishwasher (because I don't have enough dishes to fill it up, and therefore consider it wasteful), and I even avoid flushing the toilet if I only needed to pee. However, it sort of stresses me out when I see my friends and family ""waste"" water by taking very long showers (sometimes twice a day), using the dishwasher with only a few plates in (even when plates have only had dry bread crumbs on them), and flushing after every single visit to the toilet.

I know that one argument that can be used is ""well, a kg of meat uses X liters of water, so me taking a shower doesn't really matter"", and I understand and accept this as the harsh reality. However, my anxiety is more because the water we use in our homes are local resources (whereas the beef may have been produced on a different continent), and I am, I would say, ""afraid"" of running out of resources because people are wasteful. 

What are your thoughts on this? How can I get people to appreciate the resources we have and motivate them to use less, without coming across as an A-hole?",climatechange

The Power of Hope and it’s effect on human motivation.,"Hi all!

This is my first post on here, I came here after reading an extremely frightening report on climate change. 

Amongst all the doom and gloom I feel I must observe that throughout history, there have been many scenarios that have seemed hopeless, this might even be the biggest. However we have frequently overcame seemingly insurmountable odds due to hope, ingenuity and the strength of the human spirit. With the universe out there, the solutions exist. 

A social tipping point is coming, progress has new reinforcements everyday while the powers that oppose progress fight a war on two fronts, with progress and the grave. 

If we can all raise awareness and be prepared to begin an industrial and economic green revolution within the next five years we have a chance, we still have the exponential growth of technology to contribute to our efforts. Our futures here CAN be saved, and I have every confidence that they WILL BE. If you don’t have faith in anything else, have faith in the Power of Hope. 

Just to illustrate my point, with exception of those with no means of accessing the knowledge that our climate is changing for the worse, all the most intelligent people in the world across 100s of fields and in nearly all places believe in climate change, so when it comes down to it something will be attempted and it will and should be on a massive scale. 

Good luck everyone!",climatechange
My Opinion,"Most of the people around me in my daily life don’t care about climate change whatsoever. However, I personally find it quite disturbing. The thought of a changing globe and the conflicts and problems that come with it, such as rising oceans and and increased extreme weather events make me feel guilty for being one of the contributors to such a horrendous event.
  
Global warming is almost definitely going to happen, and even the naysayers must agree that any work done to prevent climate change could only lead to a healthier planet in the long run. Yet many people choose to ignore al the evidence piling up, such as rising temperatures, sea levels, increased numbers of extreme weather events, and the fact that all these seem to coincide with the massive amounts of greenhouse gases we release into the atmosphere every year. 

I have decided that I will try and reduce my own emissions if no one near me will, if not to set an example then to simply reduce my own guilt. I will reduce the amount of meat I eat and the emissions I emit by driving by using active and public transportation more frequently, as my current lifestyle doesn’t follow a “healthier planet” vision. 

                                                                          Caden",climatechange
Carbon pricing for other green house gasses,"How would carbon pricing for methane (86 GWP/20yr), HCF (3790 GWP/20yr), CFC (7020 GWP/20yr), N2O (269 GWP/20yr), and CF4 (4950 GWP/20yr) work?
I chose the 20 year global warming potential because it’s crunch time right now, and we have about 12 years to make serious change, but the values change a lot when talking about 100 year GWP. For carbon pricing of emissions, how would you go about doing it for these other greenhouse gases? Do you have people pay 84 times as much for methan emissions, or 34, which is the 100 year GWP. New reports show industrial methane emissions are a lot higher than expected and also seems like some factories in China are relseasing CFC’s into the environment. Any info or ideas about this would be greatly appreciated!",climatechange

What types of man made or natural events would cause a huge jump in global temps?,"Hi all!

&amp;#x200B;

So, I'm writing a book that is set 100 years from now (well, 90ish years). It's got dystopic and apocalyptic themes.. and I was wondering what types of environmental changes would occur in 100 years. I'd like to have the environment play a neat effect in my book, man vs nature, all that jazz. But if it's out of the realm of plausible fiction... then I'll cut that idea.

&amp;#x200B;

**So as for the real question, I was just curious as to what types of events-- any! it could be man-made, environmental, or totally fictional!-- would cause global temperatures to jump to a point that it would change the world around us -- sea levels rising, crops and overall agriculture being affected.** 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm writing in the overall history of my universe right now. My setting is North America, most specifically the Midwest and moving east. I've created a 2030 map that has the US, Canada, and Mexico borders... but i also made a general 2109 map.. where I've made some guesses as to sea levels rising (to a point want as a writer), and I changed country borders and such. 

&amp;#x200B;

All of this to say, I'm trying to map out the changes in North America and I need some guidelines from people who are smarter than me lmao.",climatechange
Looking for advice on planning for my families future,"I don’t know where else to post this but I need some sort of guidance so I can sleep better at night. We currently live in the south Tampa region of Florida. We have decent jobs along with a couple investment properties. I thought I did my due diligence a couple years ago with the rising water, the expected flooding etc. I don’t think I dug deep enough... I honestly don’t think I really wanted to until now. 
    A recent Brookings Institute report projects that the Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater region is the second-most vulnerable metro in the U.S. to the monetary consequences of climate change. By 2050 Tampa is projected to have a temperature of over 105 degrees for 119 days out of the year. 
   I work outside everyday and my families business is based on working outside. Do we run for the hills before people start to wise up? Most people I talk to down here do not think there is any sort of problem or they think the projections are way worse than what will actually happen. Our current plan is to save every penny for the next 7-10 years and move. The anxiety I have from this is unreal.",climatechange

In conversation with those who go on about natural cycles, I would like to tell them where we are in those cycles (Milankovic, etc.). Those cycles are rather well mapped, even though there are other variables less well known, especially with respect to our galactic orbit and regions of interstellar dust. If we hadn't poured so much CO2 into the atmosphere, where would be, roughly, best guess? Still in a cooling phase, or still warming from the last ice age? If we are supposed to be on a cooling trajectory, our heating planet takes on new significance, and if we are in a natural warming phase, then we are doubly screwed.",climatechange

What ive learned about climate change from social media,"Researching solely about climate change from Reddit, here is what ive learned about climate change and my thoughts/viewpoints about it.

__What have you found out about climate change?__

I have found that climate change has become an issue that most people don't usually think about in their daily lives.

Climate change affects not only humans, but wildlife and vegetation. This has been shown through the extinction of certain species.

__What conclusions have you made?__

I have concluded that the affects of climate change are everywhere and people need to change their lifestyles because of it.

__What did you base your conclusions off of?__

I based my conclusion from what I've seen in my every day life, and from what I've seen happens when we continue to cause climate change from our own actions.

__How do your actions affect climate change?__

My actions affect climate change by a small amount, things like not using single use plastics and reducing our energy use. What makes a difference is advising our friends, family, community, and more about what they can do to prevent climate change. If we all change the way we live, (reduce the amount of fossil fuels burned by using more efficient furnaces,etc.) We can make a change.",climatechange
A place for Crowd Sourcing climate change solutions?,I was wondering if there’s an irl or online space where professionals communicate the issues they’re having in developing (for example) carbon capture tech or better batteries or trying to solve the issue of energy consistency and peak usage. Essentially I’m wondering if there’s a place where the public and professionals can gather to collaborate to find solutions for climate change. Most potential answers are probably going to be stupid. But just maybe there’s an idea that’s a diamond in the rough. IMO The best think tank is a think tank with the collective knowledge of millions of people.,climatechange

In the past he has worked on an US/FRA exchange program with the Los Alamos laboratory to compare and exchange data in nuclear physics (probably bombs), he has met original scientists from the Manhattan project including Oppenheimer unless I'm very much mistaken and is good friends with Robert Dautray who is the father of the French bomb.

Both of are pro nuclear and believe nuclear energy is the cleanest we have and will have for a long time to come and considering their background and wealth of knowledge I can't see any reason to not believe them. Having done my own research I believe a combination of nuclear and hydro electric power would be a perfect to have clean renewable energy. So why are law makers backing out of nuclear so much when it is the safest cleanest energy we have available. Heck if I remember my figures correctly Germany's emissions went UP when they stopped the 'reactors. France and Sweden continue to have very low carbon emissions from their power plants for these reasons. I'm pretty sure that the law makers surround themselves with the right people so why are they shutting down nuclear power plants? Why is there not  more education on how nuclear energy works and how safe it is. This confuses me. Why would you turn your back on a highly scalable form of power that happens to be clean and safe. Am I missing something here or is the World truly mad?",climatechange

"""There is a runaway train racing toward us, and its name is climate change""...is not a scientific fact, it's the opposite","Recently a journalistic conference was convened in America (jointly by the *Columbia Journalism Review* and the *The Nation*) to survey the state of American journalism on climate change. 

Criticisms of US coverage abounded — but the criticisms also abounded with errors. In the keynote article ""[The Media Are Complacent While the World Burns](https://www.cjr.org/special_report/climate-change-media.php)"" one finds this passage:

&gt;There is a runaway train racing toward us, and its name is climate change. That is not alarmism; it is scientific fact. 

This statement is definitely NOT a statement of scientific fact — which doesn't deal in metaphors like runaway trains. The statement qualifies as magical thinking at least, and probably alarmism too.

Conference participants presumably had some more substantive criticisms of US climate coverage. Although I bet hardly any of them were more substantive than Chris Hayes' observation from 2018:

&gt; Hayes (who is an editor at large for *The Nation*) replied that his program had tried. Which was true: in 2016, “All In With Chris Hayes” spent an entire week highlighting the impact of climate change in the US as part of a look at the issues that Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump were ignoring. The problem, Hayes tweeted, was that “every single time we’ve covered [climate change] it’s been a palpable ratings killer. So the incentives are not great.”

American journalism covers climate in three distinct ways: 

1) Validating the beliefs of the Climate Denier audience, with the most spectacular assertions one can find which possess a minimum amount of scientific support.  

2) Validating the beliefs of the Climate Doomer audience, with the most spectacular assertions one can find which possess a minimum amount of scientific support. This is what's happening with the ""runaway train"" quote here.

3) Serving the audience which is actually interested in the science of climate. This audience doesn't have many beliefs which go beyond what can be shown by analytic methods. The real task of this strain of journalism is to expand the range of what can be shown by analytic methods. It's probably best to call this strain ""(actual) science journalism,"" rather than mainstream journalism.

It's stupid to fault American journalism (or any journalism) for serving the first two audiences. That's the explicit task of much mainstream journalism: To serve and form a relationship with the largest audience they can reach. Many people are more interested in having their beliefs validated than in having them analyzed (or challenged). These audiences will always exist.

The real question is: How large is that third audience? Is there a chance that it might grow to the size of the other two? If it does, then mainstream journalism will have to yield some space to more ""(actual) science journalism.""

But the keynote article for the CJR/Nation conference gives me no hope that *that* particular set of journalism watchers intends to take a single step in that direction. They're in the validating-beliefs mode, not the analytical mode. 

Plenty of analytical-mode writers publish all the time. There's no need to pay a single moment's attention to the largest mainstream outlets (for instance, network television news operations). But you have to search for them. And complaining about the belief-validating sections of the media doesn't actually make the search easier.",climatechange
Guardian Article: Humans and volcanoes caused nearly all of global heating in past 140 years,"[The article](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/30/humans-and-volcanoes-caused-nearly-all-of-global-heating-in-past-140-years) discusses a recent [study](https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/10.1175/JCLI-D-18-0555.1) on the contributions of humans and nature to early 20th century warming. The article also cites Judith Curry. I'd be interested to hear what the sub thinks and, if possible, shed some insight on the role of this early century warming in the science.

Also, the study's co-author is Friederike Otto, who's made a bit of a splash recently on German television as the poster child of ""Attribution Science"" (i.e. real-time assessments of the likelihood of extreme weather events being attributable to climate change) and I was wondering whether anyone had any thoughts on this.

How can an individual engineer have the biggest impact on climate change? (x-post from /r/askengineers),"Hey, looking for a little advice for a friend.  She has a driving need to work to reverse climate change and is trying to figure out the best way to do that.  Do you have any advice for what could be the way that she can have the most impact?

&amp;#x200B;

She has a masters in EE from a top-tier university and has been working in hardware validation for a couple years.  She's also a capable programmer and has been shifting her role to include more CS.  But her current job has nothing to do with the environment or climate change, and she's finding it to be quite a drag.

&amp;#x200B;

Right now, her (incomplete) plan is to go back to school to study chemical engineering, then use that degree as a way to get a job in clean tech.  The long-term goal is to work on carbon capture or trying to remove plastics from the ocean.  It seems to me there are a lot of unknown and undefined steps in her plan.

&amp;#x200B;

So here are a few of my questions:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

1. What's the best way for a young, capable engineer to have an impact on climate change work?
2. Is a degree in chemical engineering a good first step, or would it be a waste of time?
3. What are some companies or organizations where she could work to have an impact?  Preference for the SF Bay Area, but not a limiting factor.  Startups welcome.

This suggests that the current total carbon emissions by McDonald's is known. I can't seem to find this kind of information though anywhere, so I'm not sure where the article got these numbers.

A Deep Dive into Solar Panels.,"12.3 million. The number of homes solar panels were able to power in the US at the end of 2018. Whenever conferring with others about the energy source of the future, solar energy is almost always brought alight. Solar energy is rapidly expanding around the world, as the push for clean energy spreads across the globe. Behind solar energy are solar panels: the panels that absorb sunlight as a source of energy to create electricity for our needs. Ever since 1839, solar panels have been changing constantly and improving greatly to better coincide with the push for 100% clean, renewable energy. The talk around solar panels for the future of the world is undeniably a great amount, but it is also important to acknowledge the history of solar panels, how they work, and their current day status. 
 
Solar energy has been around ever since ancient civilization, but it wasn’t anything like the conventional solar panels seen today used to harness the sun’s energy. It wasn’t until the 1800s when the ball got rolling and solar energy was starting to form like a newly born star in the solar system. Solar energy all started based off an earth-shattering 1839 discovery found by French physicist, Edmond Becquerel. This discovery consisted of the finding of the photovoltaic effect, “a process that generates voltage or electric current in a photovoltaic cell when it is exposed to sunlight,” as Energy Education puts it. Additionally, the discovery of the photovoltaic effect was found while Becquerel was conducting research with a cell comprised of metal electrodes in a conducting solution. Consequently, Becquerel would exclaim, “shining light on an electrode submerged in a conductive solution would create an electric current,” in reference to discovering the photovoltaic effect. Later, in 1873, Willoughby Smith stumbled upon the photoconductivity of selenium, now used in solar panels today. Moreover, in 1876, William Grylls Adams and Richard Evans Day put the photovoltaic idea (originally found by Becquerel) to selenium, finding it could generate electricity when light hit it. To no one’s surprise, someone would eventually put all three discoveries to life which is exactly what happened in 1883, when Charles Fritts created the first ever working selenium cell. Charles Fritts’ newly made cell was an ingenious invention at the time, as he hoped it would compete with Edison’s coal-fired power plants. On the contrary, the new, innovative selenium cell was less than 1% efficient and had no chance of competing with Edison’s coal-fired power plants as the solar cell wasn’t a feasible way of powering millions of peoples lives. Generally, the idea of solar energy wasn’t a popular one at the time and wouldn’t be for a while. Eventually, the concept of solar energy was brought alight when Albert Einstein published a paper on the photoelectric effect and how light carries energy, happening in 1905. Hence, Albert Einstein would win The Nobel Prize in Physics 1921, “For his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect.” He would receive the prize a year later, in 1922.
 
 With the concept of solar energy gaining steam, more specifically the photoelectric and photovoltaic effect, it wasn’t until 1941 when Russell Ohl broke the barrier and invented the solar cell; different than the selenium cell invented by Charles Fritts in 1883. Similarly, like Fritts’ selenium cell, the new solar cell invented by Russell Ohl was incredibly ineffective and not a feasible option to power the lives of many at the time. The energy conversion efficiency of the cell was only 1%, thus for every 100 Joules of solar energy hitting the cell, only 1 Joule of electrical energy was created. While this was an improvement from Fritts’ cell, it wasn’t enough to be used as a legitimate source of energy worldwide, as previously mentioned. The most groundbreaking, substantial invention didn’t come until 1954, when the modern day photovoltaic cell was invented by Daryl Chapin, Calvin Fuller, and Gerald Pearson. After months of long, grueling work, the final product was the first feasible silicon cell ever invented. Originally, Daryl Chapin wanted to make a source of power for telephone systems in remote areas, therefore turning to solar energy as the option. He would later collaborate with Calvin Fuller and Gerald Pearson, as they all invented the cell in unity. Truly, this was the cell of the future as the newly invented cell had a 6% conversion efficiency, much more than the 1941 solar cell invented by Russell Ohl or the 1883 selenium cell invented by Charles Fritts. In fact, the solar call had so much potential The New York Times wrote the newly invented silicon cell, “may mark the beginning of a new era, leading eventually to the realization of one of mankind’s most cherished dreams–the harnessing of the almost limitless energy of the sun for the uses of civilization.” Even though the cell was way too costly at the time to be used by the public or companies (the solar cells costed over $100 per watt), the US military decided to fund research on the cells for the potential to power satellites in the 1950s. The funding persited, and the first ever spacecraft to use solar panels ended up being the Vanguard I in 1958. For some time, solar was still too costly for use until Dr. Elliot Berman did extensive research and was able to produce a much less expensive solar cell, bringing the cost per watt down to just $20, in the early 1970s. Coincidentally, in 1973, the energy crisis hit the US which made oil prices skyrocket forcing the US to turn to other energy options, like solar. In turn, this made the US government committed to developing solar energy (solar panels in specific) as a feasible source of energy for future uses. As a result, Jimmy Carter decided to install solar panels on the roof of the White House to spread awareness and to make a solar energy statement. Evidently, solar panels started to become more feasible as the “golden era” of solar panels for the 1900s hit in the 1980s. 
 
During the 1980s, solar panels started to become much more efficient and cheaper through research and developments. By the 1990s, many groundbreaking creations came out which helped fuel solar panel growth. For example, in 1992, the University of South Florida developed a 15.9% efficient thin-film photovoltaic cell made of cadmium telluride. Just a short time after, in 1994, the first ever solar cell exceeding 30% conversion efficiency was made. 5 years later, in 1999, a photovoltaic solar cell was developed that converted 32.3% of the sunlight that hits it into electricity. Also in 1999,  the new efficiency record for photovoltaic thin-film solar cells was hit marking in at 18.8%. In total, growth between the 1980s and 1990s was crucial to solar panels expanding. Just in 1983, the worldwide photovoltaic production was 21.3 megawatts. In 1999, that number increased to 1,000 megawatts. In conclusion, it is clear the history of solar panels was jammed packed and certainly fascinating indeed. 
 
Today, solar panels work in a very specific way. For solar panels to work, sunlight must be hitting the panel. Obviously, if there is no sun, the solar panels won’t be working at that specific moment. This is why at night, solar panels aren’t working like they are in the day. Anyway, soon after the sun hits the panel, the photovoltaic solar cell absorbs the radiation from the sun. For the sun to hit the cell, it must go through the frame, glass, and encapsulant which makes up the solar panel. Once the sun does hit the cell, after passing through the first stages of the solar panel, electrons begin to move around internally. Nevertheless, a solar cell consists of a layer of p-type silicon placed next to a layer of n-type silicon which are sandwiched between two silicon layers. Inside the n-type, there is an excess of electrons while inside the p-type, there is an excess of positively charged holes. Between the n-type silicon layer and the p-type silicon layer, there is the depletion zone where electrons fill the holes. Once this is completed, the p-type of the depletion zone now contains negatively charged ions while the n-type consists of positively charged ions. Moreover, this creates an electric field which prevents electrons in the n-type layer to fill the holes in the p-type layer. Finally, when sunlight hits the cell, electrons in the holes are ejected resulting in the formation of the holes. All in all, when the p-type and n-type layers are connected with metallic wire or any wire that can generate electric current, the electrons will travel from the sides creating electricity. In a residential solar makeup, the solar panels convert the sunlight into DC energy which is then transferred to an inverter which transfers the electricity to AC for use. For all energy not needed, it goes back to the grid. In conclusion, solar panels aren’t too complicated and work following a basic method. Without the method present, solar panels wouldn’t be able to function as they do. 
 
In today’s era, solar panels are becoming increasingly more prominent and have been over the last few years. In the last decade alone, solar has experienced an average annual growth rate of 50% amongst the US. Furthermore, there are currently over 240,000 Americans working in the solar industry with over 10,000 companies per state. In discussion with cost, the cost to install solar has rapidly dropped by more than 70% in the last decade with the average price per watt only being anywhere from $2.67 to $3.43 now. Comparing the prices to 70 years ago, there is a huge difference in cost. Currently, most solar is installed in Europe and East Asia which account for over 70% of global installations. The least happens to be in Africa, accounting for less than 1% of total global installations. Installations have been growing like wildfire ever since a jump in 2010. In 2000, there were no installations of solar in the US whatsoever. By 2016, the yearly installation reached almost 14,000 watts across residential PV (photovoltaic), non-residential PV, Utility PV, and Utility CSP. The US has also been emphasizing solar, with the annual additions of new electric capacity always growing each year ever since 2010. In 2010, that number was just 4%. In 2018, it was 29% out of all possible energies. Nevertheless, in the US, California has been a big player in solar with the most installations out of any state coming from California. In fact, California beats the next 9 states combined in terms of annual residential PV installations. By January 1st, 2020, California is making it mandatory for all new homes to come installed with solar panels. In terms of efficiency, most solar panels have above 20% conversion levels now. There are actually 7 different types of solar panels, with different types varying per company. Finally, solar panels can be found in solar farms, on residential homes, and commercial homes primarily. It is good to note solar farms are the most effective ways for solar panels to work and the most prominent way. To illustrate how solar is truly on the rise, the global solar energy sector is projected to reach $422 billion by 2022 up from $86 billion in 2016, according to Allied Market Research. In conclusion, it is clear solar panels are on the rise and becoming the energy choice of the future. Within 10 years, solar will have expanded greatly around the world like it has in the past 10. 
 
Clearly, the history of solar panels is quite eventful, the way they work is very fascinating and complex, and their current day status is very promising. Without solar panels in life, the world would suffer major losses without one of the most popular clean energy options around. Not only this, renewable energy would have to be limited to the current day, less promising options like wind energy. Jobs would also be lost, the economy wouldn’t be the same, and solar companies would seize to exist. In a world without solar panels, what would it be like?

"As a layman, I believe the main killer of climate change will be all the wars it spurs","I've always said the science behind global climate change, appears to pretty solid, and to me talking to a climate change denier is like debating a flat earther.

I want to run this idea past a couple people on here.

Basically Homo Sapiens is 200,000 years old. Besides maybe ideology, and religion, what has been a main motivating factor for wars? Limited resources, and power and control over those resources. When I play Civ V, I gotta delay my civilization's progress if I aim to take out another, but on a cost/benefit analysis that rival civilization's resources are main motivating factor. And I think we got a similar situation here.

We got 7.6 billion people. Population numbers continuing to rise. This can NOT rise indefinitely. And not when climate change is actually going to affect land areas, I.E. where humans live, profoundly more than out in the middle of the ocean, I suspect land is actually going to get a lot hotter than say 4c.

It's not so much the farm lands being turned to desert and displacement of hundreds of millions from coastal cities that scares me...I think this climate change is going to set off potentially the proverbial WWIII. You're gonna have starving masses similar to Soylent Green, they're going to be pissed. We're seeing the rise of nationalists, I'm not getting into politics, but basically instead of humans figuring out a way to share the earth's resources for their survival, they're looking to horde them to themselves. It's the rise of authoritarianism and a look to strong man dictatorships in major countries, that is leading me to see parallel's to the lead up to the WWII situation, except today's weapons are profoundly more destructive than they were in the 1940's.

IIRC they say one of the reasons we may have yet to ever discover intelligent life is because it figured out how to destroy itself, before it figured out interstellar travel. Right now we got the nuclear arsenal the world over to destroy ourselves as opposed to interstellar travel.

So I just wanted to see what others think of this idea of mine.",climatechange

Why are some people so resolutely opposed to accepting climate change,"i have been posting on many topics  on a different forum for quite a while.  I have done a few posts on climate change. And have noticed that many people are seemingly irrationally opposed to consideration of evidence on the topic.

The most recent topic that i chose was sea level rise. I chose this topic because it seemed to me that the evidence of sea level rise is indisputable.  Not only are sea levels rising, they are rising at an accelerating rate.   ( from 1.8 mm per year in 1900 to about 3.5 mm per year recently)  I asked a simple question:  what is causing this phenomenon?

To me, the only possible explanation is added heat from greenhouse gasses.   But i was open to any alternative explanation that might be proposed.  I got answers like... sedimentation is causing sea level rise, and seismic activity may be reducing the size of ocean basins.  Both of these explanations are easily dismissed since they are long term and constant and therefore could not account for a short term acceleration of sea level rise.  I have had someone argue that in order to accept air temperature readings there would have to be millions  of ground stations all read by a single individual. I have had people argue that any co2 mitigation strategy... no matter how small... would result in the collapse of the world economy. And of course there is the persistent meme that all of the scientists in the world are part if a gigantic plot that requires that the keep producing phony studies in order to line their pockets with government grants.

I have to say that the people proposing these arguments are clearly intelligent, and not obviously insincere.   I find it confounding that they seem to be so rooted in their opposition to this topic that no amount of patience, or rationality will dislodge them from their intractable opposition to open minded consideration of the evidence.

How does irrigation affect the climate?,"Water is one of the most important things related to the climate, but I've hardly ever heard talk about irrigation and climate change. But surely irrigation has an effect one way or another, about 2,700,000,000,000,000 liters of water are used for irrigation. Water vapor is a powerful greenhouse gas but precipitates out quickly; clouds, snow, and ice have high albedo; water weathers rocks absorbing CO2; water helps plants absorb CO2; irrigating areas changes their albedo; plants release water via evapotranspiration. 

An example of water vapor being dependent on land use is the Amazon rainforest, which is mostly self-watering by absorbing and transpiring rainwater. Farmland also changes the local water vapor concentration, by irrigating, by forming the land to absorb water rather than have runoff, and by changing rates of evapotranspiration compared to wildland.

Irrigation causes a lot of huge changes, some of which cancel each other. Anyone know what the net effect is?",climatechange

Food Towers as a Method to Futureproof?,"Guys,
I've been thinking, and this is what I've thought. As it stands, all we need in life is food, water and shelter, and efficiency is key. I believe the society we live in (I speak as an Australian) is geared towards burning energy to stimulate an economy. Without business, managing the cost of living would become near impossible and many would suffer. The problem I forsee is that the business we promote is unsustainable for the environment and also for ourselves, and we will ultimately run ourselves into the ground. 

[tldr] So here is my idea... Why don't we condense our populus into towers, each of which can support its own capacity of residents through hydroponics. I fear we will be forced to retreat indoors if we leave this climate change issue for too long, and this is a solution I believe could work. 

I would love to hear from each and every one of you, with your thoughts about this and ideas on the topic.

Idea I had,"Remember in 2014 when people were posting video’s of them emptying a bucket of ice over their head everywhere for ALS and people all around the world started doing it and nominating their friends?
What if we started something similar, like for example someone plants a tree, posts pictures of it on social media and nominates their friends to do the same.
The main excuse people have when you ask them why they don’t eat less meat or something like that is that one person isn’t going to save the world. This challenge fixes that problem, as planting just one tree and nominating your friends who in turn nominate other people can create a huge chain reaction.

How does CO2 causes earth to heat up?,"Does anyone have good scientific facts on how CO2 causes global warming?

Air is 21% oxygen, 78% nitrogen and 0.04% CO2. CO2 has gone from 300 ppm to  415 ppm in last century and could get to  500ppm soon. While this is a huge increase in CO2 it is still a very small fraction of the air.  There is not much difference in 0.04% and 0.05%

For sure CO2 gas is a better insulator than  nitrogen or  oxygen. I believe O and N  have r value of about 0.97 per inch while CO2 is 1.5.  However given the small percentage of CO2 in the air,  i suspect it would not change the overall insulation properties of air.

CO2 can absorb infrared radiation whereas oxygen and nitrogen do not. However, again since CO2 makes up such a small fraction of air, I can't see this making huge change in earth's temperature.

The most interesting theories I have heard relate to how CO2 amplifies the amount of  water vapour that air can hold. Since water vapor and clouds have a huge effect on earths temperature this sounds more plausible. The only way I understand how C02 effects water vapour is that CO2 will warm the air, thus warm air holds more moisture. Again we are back to the small percentage of CO2 and could that small percentage have a large impact on the airs moisture content. Maybe there are other interactions at play.

How do we know Earth's orbital patterns are not effecting climate change more than humans?,"I know I might get some flack here, and I think we should be doing everything we can to stop the hazardous pollution of our planet, but I am just not convinced it is solely humans that are responsible for the current warming we are seeing. In my recent research I have come across many other natural processes that could lead to the warming of our planet. The history of the climate of this planet is actually far from stable, as only 10,000 years ago, our planet was in a full blown ice age, that we still don't fully understand how it got out of. The orbit of the earth is also very diverse. Aside from the regular orbit and rotation on its axis that cause the 4 seasons, there are factors such as milankovitch cycles, axial obliquity, axial &amp; apsidal precession, and eccentricity to name a few, that could all be effecting how the heat from the sun is dispersed on the surface of our planet, just in a much more subtle way (every 10,000-100,000 years or so).

Another thing is the natural release of CO2 from pockets in the ice, or from volcanic eruptions that release millions of tons of CO2 into the atmosphere in a matter of hours or days.

I would like to reiterate that I think we should be doing everything we can to stop the destructive pollution of our planet. I just think we need to be looking at the bigger picture of climate change as a whole to fully understand the problem we are facing.",climatechange
i’m mad about this crappy climate change organization / thoughts on approaching the climate change discussion,"sorry in advance, i really needed to rant.

Today i went to an interview with this organization (rather not name it) that basically advertises itself as on the forefront of fighting climate change, etc. it was advertised as a summer job for students. so first red flag, the job is fundraising, going from house to house to get money. i would get to keep about half. feels a little dirty to me. that is the whole job. talking to people about climate change and asking for money, and then keeping half. oh also if i don’t hit a certain quota per day they don’t have to pay me. so i’m basically working off commission. okay, i’m thinking, this organization needs money to see change happen, i guess i’ll just do my best in the interview and see what happens. 

so i go to the interview. the questions are very forceful and i don’t feel like the woman respects me very much. she nods her head at certain answers and makes small facial indications that she doesn’t like what i’m saying at other times. one thing really jumps out at me: she asks me what i would say to these people to inform them of how important climate change is. i say “well, we’re all in this together and we all need to act to see change happen for us. everyone is affected by this. we need to make sure we’re making the right personal decisions like switching to electric cars for instance and also the right public decisions such as voting and supporting climate change campaigns.” she immediately says “well this isn’t the people’s fault. it’s the industries and the government” and essentially says it’s not up to us (?????) she didn’t say “oh but that isn’t the focus of this campaign” or “but when you talk to people stick to talking about the public side.” no. she literally said essentially that personal decisions don’t make a difference for climate change. i didn’t really know what to do cause i didn’t want to be rude so i kind of nodded. 

then at the end of the interview she said maybe a full paragraph about how many other candidates there were and how qualified they all were and how i had seen them when i was waiting and how they needed to get people on the team fast and that they were actually hiring that very day and then extended the job offer. i was kind of flustered and she pressured me a lot and so i was just like “yes i accept” and agreed to starting the next day and walked out of there feeling super weird and like i had been almost forced into it against my will.

then i was thinking about how weird the whole thing was and i ended up talking with both my parents and they agreed that it seemed kind of fishy and also because i would be commuting (v expensive) i literally could not afford if i didn’t make the quota one day so i figured it’s not worth it to even try because i would lose so much money just by giving it a shot and i could lose a ton of a money even if i did make the quota for a long time. anyways so i decide to call them and say i changed my mind, i felt bad but i also didn’t feel that bad cause i felt i had kind of been pressured into it with no time to think about it. so i call.

so this is the part that really pissed me off. i call to tell them i’m backing out. he says “why, do you not believe in the cause? is climate change not important to you?” and i said “no, it is, but i don’t think i can afford the commute.” and he says, “well we have people who commute from [place farther away than where i live]. isn’t where you live closer?” and i said “yes but this isn’t the right time for me to do this” and he said “well the point of no return is in 12 years, when is gonna be the right time for you?” and then he kept talking about how much the organization is doing to combat climate change and basically asking me if i didn’t care at all, extremely patronizing questions and i eventually said “i respect what you guys are doing but i can’t take the job right now.” 

i hung up from that phone call so angry. i’m so angry right now. i can’t believe this supposedly reputable organization would use tactics like that to keep me in. i’m so glad i got out when i did because they probably would have been just as manipulative if i actually worked with them.

okay, so first of all, how could that woman, the freaking director of this program, possibly say that personal actions have nothing to do with it??? is that just how she sleeps at night? like i don’t understand. how could someone who’s supposed to care about this issue actually say that? it freaking astounds me that that person exists, that people like that could exist. it is everyone that is responsible for climate change. individuals, governments, industry, infrastructure. most parts of the developed world have been built off the backs of fossil fuels. you can’t just turn only corporations into the enemy, or only demand change from the government and that’s it. that is such a freaking victim mentality, such a disempowered position to put yourself in. why would anyone do that expect to feel okay about not trying in their personal life?? i watched a video from hank green (vlogbrothers, i think it was called what game of thrones is really about) talking about how we have ALL benefitted from fossil fuel use. modern society exists today because of fossil fuel use. it’s not about demonizing a certain sect of humanity. it’s about actually moving towards a cleaner and brighter future where we can ALL coexist. demonizing certain people or peoples is not sustainable (no pun intended.) it is only a way to feel better about ourselves. and this is ultimately extremely selfish. we HAVE to take personal responsibility. it is the only way. we have to be humble enough to realize that we are part of the problem too. 

second of all, why would they fucking try to guilt me into staying? what a dumb way to get campaigners. at this point i almost feel like it’s some sort of scam, except that it was with this pretty reputable organization and i’m so angry that they would treat me like that. what i’m most angry about is that it worked. it made me feel like a shitty person. not because i am or think i am but because that’s how he was treating me. this CANNOT be part of the climate change campaign. when we weaponize morality like this, when we say you’re bad for not caring about this. it turns people off. no one is going to listen to you if you’re patronizing in that way. no one is going to listen to someone that talks down to them. person to person respect is the most important part of moving such a huge campaign like this along. WHY would we try to manipulate people? this problem is so real, we have to let the truth speak for itself. trying to manipulate people literally undermines the truth and gravity of the situation. it makes it underhanded instead of honorable to talk about this. we have to find a way to reach people about this without saying they’re bad for not caring about it in the past. i want to make it clear: if you didn’t know or care about climate change before, there should be no judgment on you. by the same token you’re not a “good” person for caring about it. it’s going to kill us. stop trying to pretend your survival instincts make you a saint. (no offense. like we need people who care about it, of course, and like i said i think there is an honor in it. it just pisses me off when people act like they’re above other people for caring about it.) can we stop putting people into categories of good and bad??? this issue is too important for anyone to put their ego into it. it’s not about me or you or anyone else. it’s about how we’re aLL GOING TO DIE! we need to give this issue the respect it deserves. it doesn’t need manipulation. our voices need to be a medium to spread the message, not a way to make us feel self righteous. 

if you’ve made it this far, damn, and thanks. i don’t usually post rants like this but i don’t think i could have let this stupid situation go without getting it out of my system. do you have any thoughts?",climatechange

help choosing between the outdated AR4 Scenarios,"  

Dear climate change community, 

I have a bit of an academic situation and I wanted to know your opinion regarding the subject.  I am a PhD Student, I am doing my PhD in Sustainable Environmental  Architectural Design in the tropics. Anyhow, the thing is I am using this software called Meteonorm  ( [https://meteonorm.com/en/](https://meteonorm.com/en/) ) to generate a series of weather files to generate a territorial climate zoning using the Koeppen method but changing the years of the climate normals, first from 1981 to 1990, then 1991 to 2012 and then a prediction for 2060. My problem is, even though the software is a recent updated version, the thing still uses the AR4 IPCCs scenarios from 2007, thus in order to generate the future files, one must choose between the scenarios B1, A1B and A2. 

At the beginning I had no doubt in using the A2 Scenario, since the last year IPCC special report of Global warming of 1.5°C was a bit alarming and I thought the temperature ranges (2.0 to 5.4 °C) seem to fit on the 100 year predictions, but then I read a paper from 2015 ([https://www.nature.com/articles/srep09957](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep09957) )  which I understood that the most likely scenario was A1B and it made sense, but some years have gone by and thins have evolved a lot in the last years, I understand the AR4 is a bit outdated and the latest reports offer a better and more detailed prediction of what we may encounter but, what would be your recommendation regarding the subject, do you thing conditions may have changed and the A2 is more likely than the A1B? or the A1B still fit the range of possibilities?

Thanks for your time,",climatechange

Then, sometimes I try to focus on the positives: the amazing work being done to clean up our planet, the steps we are taking in the right direction, and the fact that IF we can stave off complete annihilation we will have made a world that I actually will want to live in.

Best/most efficient trees to plant in the UK,"I've done some googling but couldn't find an answer to this, apologies if it's been asked already...

What is the best tree to plant in the UK to offset carbon emissions. I know offsetting alone is not a solution to climate change, but I figure it all helps. I'm trying to plant and hand out trees to other people to plant in the local area. At the moment I'm using whatever saplings are growing in my garden - mostly sycamore (there are some large trees that drop seeds all over my garden). 

Since they're growing naturally this seems the best thing to do as buying or getting others would require more CO2 emissions to get the trees but I wondered if there was a more 'efficient' tree to grow that I could get easily.

TL:DR what's the most CO2 efficient tree to grow in the UK?",climatechange

How exactly is climate change an existential threat?,"I'm fully prepared for people to roast me for even asking, but I'm trying to be thoughtful about this issue...


I'm all for being prepared for, or better yet, trying to prevent any doomsday scenarios, but I really haven't come to terms with what the doomsday scenario for climate change is.

I could imagine a worst case scenario that in maybe 100-1,000 years climate change has gotten so bad that islands become absorbed by the ocean, or that coastal cities are flooded and the landscape of the world as we know it is forever changed. 

If this scenario occurred I would imagine that potentially millions of people would die or be misplaced, which would be a massive tragedy, but even then, I can't imagine how it would be an existential threat to humanity.

I would assume that humans would adapt and find somewhere on the planet to survive and continue to advance humanity.. Would we not?

To me, that seems like the worst case scenario, which would not be a threat to the existence of our planet or human race, and is still a rather far-off or maybe even far-fetched scenario.

I'm not denying that climate change is real or that it may have massive consequences, but when people describe it as an existential threat, it makes me think that I'm either misunderstanding something or that it's being massively overhyped.",climatechange
Fear,"Climate Change is something that terrifies me unlike anything that I’ve feared before. When I was younger I feared the dark, slept with a nightlight...it was a blue light. I felt so grown up when I finally was able to turn it off and sleep in the dark. Then I was scared of thunderstorms and how loud they were. I felt so grown up when I could not only see they were harmless (to me being inside a house and all) but that I could fall asleep to them at night. Then I was scared of spiders. One jumped on my shirt and stared at my right in the eyes. They were alien to me. Again, I felt so grown up when I realized they only wanted bugs, not people. And again I could finally feel grown up when I could catch a spider and let it outside without any fear. Then I was afraid of nuclear war. (Quite the jump I know) I kept seeing news about Russia and North Korea that had me frightened about the possibility. I had dreams of mushroom clouds and my family screaming. I will never not be afraid of that. Sometimes when things get too quiet, I get a bit anxious as if I’m expecting a nuke to go off. I don’t think I’ll never not fear that. Then came climate change. Always knew it was happening, never denied it. The IPCC report in October had me on edge but I believed we could do it. I took an ecology class, learned how we could kill the Earth 6 ways from Sunday. I had a couple panic attacks every week for about a month. I feared for my family once again. But it was a different fear because when I looked outside all I was were the trees starting to bloom, the grass swaying in the wind. Everything seemed fine. I guess it was my first taste of what you would call Mortal Fear. The trouble I’m having with this fear is the justification. Its not like a Nuke, its not sudden or a single event. We’ve been harming the Earth for over 200 years and she can only do the same to us in return. Whenever I read about the effects I try to tell myself it won’t be a wave of heat that will turn everything into desert: its a slower, gradual process. And I think thats why my fear is worse than before. Because I’m seeing the beauty that is today and what we will loose should we do nothing. Then I read about the recent happenings in the arctic. Still cant think about it for more than a minute without panicking. Not used to it yet. I try to tell myself even if we do everything right the consequences will still hit us and we deserve it, so just roll with the punches and keep your family safe.

Climate is a self-regulating system,"No one doubts that the level of carbon dioxide has increased since the 19th century or that this leads to increased global average temperature, measurements and observations in ice and sea sediments show this. But measurements also show that there are natural fluctuations of more than 100 ppm and that nature and the atmosphere is a self-regulating system. The ice sheet builds up at Ice Age and when the temperature rises, the melting ice cools down the increasingly heated seas and works a bit like a thermostat in an ordinary car. Ocean currents change the direction because of temperature changes and if the North Atlantic Current of the Gulf Stream were to end, there would be several degrees colder in the Nordic and British islands, which would counteract the melting of the Arctic ice.

Increased temperature in the oceans leads to stronger low pressure with increased cloudiness and stronger winds. The cloud formation shields the earth from the sun radiation, which inhibits the warming. And the winds bring up dust in the atmosphere, which also filters away energy from inhalation. Along with smoke from the increased number of forest fires from areas with prolonged drought.

There are many self-regulating mechanisms like these. But the deeper and more extensive low pressures will also lead to destruction and flooding. While forests and settlements will be burned down in the hinterland and in high-altitude terrain, floods on rivers and coasts will drowning crops and settlements and destroy drinking water resources. And then the darkness comes. The clouds and dust shield of the earth may after a long cooling process end up with a new Ice Age. Which would be needed as the ice since the mid of the 19th century has melted at an ever increasing rate. And inland ice is not only temperature regulating but a vital freshwater resource.

The current level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere corresponds to a global temperature rise of about 15 degrees Celsius. But this will not mean that we will avoid cold winters and get tropical summers with warm, comfortable nights. Rather, on the contrary, the energy supplement would largely consist of different forms of destructive kinetic energy. In the end, the temperatures will fall and the winds will slow down and eventually the shielding cloud and dust layers will dissolve and the sunshine will once again reach the earth's surface. And a new, more stable climate era starts with new ice resources.

My parents have been surprisingly agreeable with suggestions I’ve made, like only getting red meat once or twice a month and mainly eating poultry.

But recently it’s the though has been going through my head that this doesn’t matter. What I’m doing isn’t even a drop in the bucket. And even if it did we’ve probably passed the tipping point.

So can I get some cautious optimism? I ain’t suicidal, I just want something to ease the crushing existential dread",climatechange
A debate on climate change,"I had a discussion at work with a co worker today about climate change... it didn’t go well... my style of debating climate change is first o state the cause and the change of CO2 over the years(the  General hypothesis). To rationalize the hypothesis like everybody seems to do, we have a cause in rising CO2, and the effect is an increase in extreme weather events, ocean acidification, forest fires and droughts... etc... the usual doom and gloom.... he then went on a I would say literal 21mins argument against the IPCC report and all the scientific wrong problems that he has found in the reports... I ended the debate with a you can believe and do what you wish as will I, but the fact is CO2 concentration is rising and we are getting environmental events that we can’t explain because of this... am I wrong? Or does his argument about the IPCC report scientifically mistake/problems carry weight?",climatechange
Climate change in Romania,"[The first large tornado in Romania (video in link)](https://www.g4media.ro/video-tornada-in-judetul-calarasi-un-autocar-cu-40-de-persoane-la-bord-a-fost-aruncat-de-pe-sosea-7-oameni-fiind-raniti-zece-case-au-ramas-fara-acoperisuri.html)

So this is the first large tornado I have seen or heard of in Romania. There have also been talks in the last months about Saharan dust storms. Also, a considerable percent of trees in Transilvania have been brought down by violent storms, in the last 3-4 years.

I know that there is an air current that takes dust from Sahara to the Amazonian forests. Is it possible it is already disrupted? Or is it quite normal that Saharan wind goes up towards Balkans and the Pontic steppe? Also, what might influence the increasing intensity of the winds?",climatechange
Is a focus on carbon emissions an oversimplification?,"To start with, I'll just let you guys know I'm writing from the perspective of the UK, so my experience of climate change discourse is very much based on discussions happening here. 

Now to my question. This morning I was listening to the radio and the news bulletin said government advisors were claiming we need to switch entirely to electric cars by 2030. The bulletin ended, however, by saying that it was uncertain whether or not enough cobalt could be mined to achieve this goal. 

I've been thinking about this a lot recently. Climate change discourse (in the UK at least) seems very much focused on carbon emissions and getting carbon neutral, to the extent that technological solutions still seem to be the norm in this discourse. I'm talking electric cars, wind turbines, solar panels, etc. Although I advocate all of these methods of renewable energy, are we just going to be swapping one crisis for another? 

I'll explain further. What I mean is, if the UK was to switch to electric cars by 2030, would the intensive mining of cobalt in other countries (I assume you can't mine cobalt in the UK) mean we'll simply be promoting the emission of carbon elsewhere? So even though the UK will be able to say it's carbon neutral (in terms of transport at least), it will basically have offset that by causing more emissions elsewhere.

By swapping the crisis I also mean we'll be swapping a greenhouse gases crisis for a resource crisis. Surely the mining of all these resources will have a huge impact on the landscape and habitats. Furthermore, resources aren't unlimited. 

So my question, essentially, is: is focusing only on carbon emissions and getting carbon neutral an oversimplification of the issue in an attempt to make it easier to sell and understand? Don't get me wrong, I 100% back reducing carbon emissions and going carbon neutral, but I can't help but feel the consequences of this process haven't been considered fully. It seems that, as with the majority of the climate change debate, the vastness of this crisis isn't fully being comprehended and instead simple and quick fixes are being attempted. 

Totally willing to have my mind changed though! In fact, I'd rather someone did change it because my view is a bit depressing/complicated/it makes my brain hurt.",climatechange

When will the world end due to the effect of global climate change?,"As we all know, climate change is affecting our Earth tremendously, mostly because of humans, but also a bit naturally. Anyway, I’ve seen many articles saying that world will end if we don’t change something about our habits of using things that emit greenhouse gases. This scares me, but the thing is, I don’t fully buy it. Every story is different.

One article said that the world will end in 20 years. Another said 50. AOC said 12. A different article says it’s bogus. What should I believe? I need a reliable article to use and you guys are the people who I would expect to know.

What are your guys’ thoughts on this. IMO, I’ve heard the “world will end because of climate change” thing before and people have been saying it for a long time, and if those claims were true, the world would’ve ended a couple years ago.

These claims seem more urgent, however. Idrk. I just need your guy’s help on a helpful source for this.",climatechange

Honest skeptic here looking for answers.,"Hi, I’m what some consider to be a “lukewarmer”, or climate agnostic. (Criteria I use: I tend to think the science is strongest for an RCP range of 3-6 not 8.5, and ECS range of 2-4) 

Unfortunately I’ve found that challenging *any* report (whether scientific, science-y, ideological media, or Hollywood movie star) on climate catastrophe, I’m often shouted down as a “denier”. 

I honestly,politely and in an open minded way, seek for answers to the truth that lies between “global warming is a hoax” and “humankind on earth has 12 years to go before certain apocalypse”

For what it’s worth, I do believe that man plays a significant role in global warming and individuals and governments need to act. 

Are there any topics in the above spectrum that *are* open to discuss without being labeled a denier?",climatechange
I want to do more. What can I do?,"I personally believe that the only solution to climate change is massive institutional change on a governmental level. If the governments of the world act as if this is the dire situation that it really is, we can mitigate the damage before it’s too late. We need to hold our politicians and governments accountable, and we all need to do a lot more to force change in the US (I single out the US because I’m American). I read about mass protests and student walk outs in Europe, and I wonder why this isn’t happening in the US.

I know it’s important that we all do our part, plant trees, recycle, etc.  but the little things that we can do on a daily basis are not enough. It makes me sick that people are not rising up and demanding action now...  but sadly, I am also one of those who is talking the talk but not walking the walk.

I’m an American living in Asia. I have a life here, and I don’t know when I’ll be coming back to the US to live. I’m not really in a position to be organizing protests in the country that I live in... and I live in a big city where I can’t plant trees. We all have daily lives, and sometimes it’s often not practical for us to do the things we’d like to do. Like it’s not practical for me to move back to the US just so I can protest about climate change. 

So what can I do from abroad? I’m more than happy to protest when I’m back in the states to visit. But besides that? What can I do? Are there good charities I could donate to that might actually make a difference? Are there organizations I can join where I can put some time and money in to help? Is there anything else that I can do to help that I might just not be thinking of? Should I write my congressman or congresswoman? Would that do any good, especially since my US residency is in an already very liberal place? 

I would love any suggestions anyone could give me.",climatechange

Electric Arc carbon sequestration via renewable sorces? An interesting patent has expired.,"I just learned that as of 04/25/2019 (yesterday) the pattent on a technology that uses electrical arc to bust apart CO2 back into O2, O3, and Carbon just became public domain. https://patents.google.com/patent/US3113086A/en

I imagine that this could be hooked up to wind turbines and other renewables to create carbon capture stations. I wonder how large something like this could be scaled up. Carbon separation from CO2 is much more effective under exposure to UV light so I'd be curious to know if the chamber which contains the  electrical arc could be exposed to sunlight somehow (bubble of transparent material that doesn't impede UV, possibly glass?) if carbon sequestration yield could be increased? (https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2003/03/030320073502.htm)

The thing about electricity is that even after arcing, it still exists and needs to ground. In theory this system could simply be a relay on a path to utilization of the same electricity for consumer purposes.

I'm interested in informing a climate skeptic. Any suggestions?,"Hi all,

I'm an environmental science student and my bf recently told me about a weird interaction he had with a friend. His friend said he believes climate change is a hoax, mainly based on information he's gotten from a guy named Dan Peña, who endorses Donald Trump and appears to have some kind of vested interests in supporting the longevity of the fossil fuel industry and lobbying against the development of clean energy (though I haven't found anything directly tying him to it at this point).

I'm looking for good material that debunks Peña's outlandish claims about the ""climate change hoax"", but I can't seem to find any videos of direct responses to Peña's claims that would be easily understood by someone with little understanding of climate science. I find that showing skeptics research papers and statistics never really changes their views, so I want to try an approach that would work better for this type of person. 

Can anyone point me in the direction of some interesting, stimulating, maybe funny videos that debate climate skeptics, that I can use to sway this denier to see the evidence instead of just making him feel overwhelmed/belittled by dumping a bunch of statistics on him? Also, if anyone can help me find any evidence that points out possible conflicts of interest between Dan Peña and his vehement climate change denial, that would be very helpful!

Why is more heat trapped by greenhouse gases when trying to exit the atmosphere rather than trying to enter the atmosphere?,"Because if the heat was trapped when entering the atmosphere at the same rate it is trapped when trying to leave the atmosphere, then adding CO2 to the atmosphere would probably decrease earth’s temperature. 

Disclaimer: not a climate change denier just trying to learn


EDIT: Nevermind, it’s because light enters a uv radiation (short-wave radiation) and leaves as infrared radiation (long-wave) after it has struck earths surface. Long-wave radiation has less energy (energy has been lost to earths surface) and this is the radiation that CO2 traps as and impedes from leaving the atmosphere.",climatechange

\- Populations across the world becoming more developed (Thus using tons more resources that they traditionally used in the past) **If you take energy use alone into account, we now use 5 TIMES the amount of energy than we did back in the 1950s) Coal/gas/oil use STILL rising fast.**

\- The actual impact of rising sea levels and loss of land due to this and urbanisation / soil erosion.

\- The declining availability of ground water in MANY regions across the world which those people totally depend on.

\- (Plus many other countless factors - changes or collapses of delicate ecosystems has knock on effects)
